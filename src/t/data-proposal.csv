01;213;David Chavalarias,Jean-Philippe Cointet;The Reconstruction of Science Phylogeny;We are facing a real challenge when coping with the continuous acceleration of scientific production and the increasingly changing nature of science. In this article, we extend the classical framework of co-word analysis to the study of scientific landscape evolution. Capitalizing on formerly introduced science mapping methods with overlapping clustering, we propose methods to reconstruct phylogenetic networks from successive science maps, and give insight into the various dynamics of scientific domains. Two indexes - the pseudo-inclusion and the empirical quality - are introduced to qualify scientific fields and are used for reconstruction validation purpose. Phylogenetic dynamics appear to be strongly correlated to these two indexes, and to a weaker extent, to a third one previously introduced (density index). These results suggest that there exist regular patterns in the "life cycle" of scientific fields. The reconstruction of science phylogeny should improve our global understanding of science evolution and pave the way toward the development of innovative tools for our daily interactions with its productions. Over the long run, these methods should lead quantitative epistemology up to the point to corroborate or falsify theoretical models of science evolution based on large-scale phylogeny reconstruction from databases of scientific literature.;2000000;2000000
02;213;Marc Newman;Who Is the Best Connected Scientist?A Study of Scientific Coauthorship Networks;Using data from computer databases of scientific papers in physics, biomedical research, and computer science, we have constructed networks of collaboration between scientists in each of these disciplines. In these networks two scientists are considered connected if they have coauthored one or more papers together. We have studied many statistical properties of our networks, including numbers of papers written by authors, numbers of authors per paper, numbers of collaborators that scientists have, typical distance through the network from one scientist to another, and a variety of measures of connectedness within a network, such as closeness and betweenness. We further argue that simple networks such as these cannot capture the variation in the strength of collaborative ties and propose a measure of this strength based on the number of papers coauthored by pairs of scientists, and the number of other scientists with whom they worked on those papers. Using a selection of our results, we suggest a variety of possible ways to answer the question Who is the best connected scientist?;100000;1000
