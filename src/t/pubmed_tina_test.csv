Hypertension, abdominal obesity, highblood glucose levels, and abnormal blood lipid levels characterize metabolicsyndrome. Therapeutic treatment of the metabolic syndrome confers a significantrisk reduction for both type 2 diabetes and premature cardiovascular events. Inthe hospital setting, the management of hyperglycemia, one of the clinicalcomponents of the metabolic syndrome, has been secondary in importance to thecondition that prompted admission. Hyperglycemia in the hospitalized patient hasbeen associated with increased lengths of stay, higher rates of hospital-acquiredinfections, and increased mortality. Early recognition and treatment ofhyperglycemia and the associated metabolic components that comprise the metabolicsyndrome may reduce morbidity and mortality in the hospital setting. Moreaggressive interventions will aid in reducing costs while simultaneouslyimproving patient care and safety.",16462412,16462412

Although HIV infection can cause distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSP),the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to treat HIV infectionhas resulted in a significant number of patients developing a clinicallyindistinguishable form of toxic neuropathy. The predominant symptom, regardlessof etiology, is excruciating unremitting pain, resistant to pharmacologicaltreatments, that leads to a reduction in the ability to conduct activities ofdaily living and, eventually, inability to ambulate. Since withdrawal fromnucleoside therapy is not typically recommended, a more thorough understanding ofthe etiology and pathophysiology underlying nucleoside-induced peripheralneuropathy, through basic and clinical research endeavors, will aid in thedevelopment of new therapeutic treatments aimed at alleviating or amelioratingpain.

The present study determined theability of the analogs to inhibit NIC-evoked (86)Rb(+) efflux from rat thalamicsynaptosomes to assess functional interaction with alpha4beta2* nAChRs. In aconcentration-dependent manner, NIC evoked (86)Rb(+) efflux (EC(50) = 170nmol/L). Analog-induced inhibition of NIC-evoked (86)Rb(+) efflux varied over aapproximately 450-fold range. Analogs with long n-alkyl chain lengths(C(9)-C(12)) inhibited efflux in the low nmol/L range (IC(50) = 9-20 nmol/L),similar to dihydro-beta-erythroidine (IC(50) = 19 nmol/L). Compounds with shortern-alkyl chain lengths (C(1)-C(8)) produced inhibition in the low micromol/L range(IC(50) = 3-12 micromol/L). C(10) and C(12) analogs completely inhibitedNIC-evoked efflux, whereas C(1-9) analogs produced maximal inhibition of only 10%to 60%. While the C(10) analog N-n-decylnicotinium iodide (NDNI) did not producesignificant inhibition of NIC-evoked dopamine release in previously reportedstudies, NDNI possesses high affinity for [(3)H]NIC binding sites (K(i) = 90nmol/L) and is a potent and efficacious inhibitor of NIC-evoked (86)Rb(+) effluxas demonstrated in the current studies.

7084787977243506621,16594644,The AAPS journal,Uetrecht J,"Drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs) are a major problem, in large partbecause of their unpredictable nature. If we understood the mechanisms of thesereactions better, they might be predictable. Their unpredictable nature alsomakes mechanistic studies very difficult, especially prospective clinicalstudies. Animal models are vital to most biomedical research, and they are almostthe only way to test basic hypotheses of DHRs, such as the involvement ofreactive metabolites. However, useful animal models of DHRs are rare because DHRsare also unpredictable in animals. For example, sulfonamide-induced DHRs inlarge-breed dogs appear to be valid because they are very similar to the DHRsthat occur in humans; however, the incidence is only approximately 0.25%, andlarge-breed dogs are difficult to use as an animal model. Two more practicalmodels are penicillamine-induced autoimmunity in the Brown Norway rat andnevirapine-induced skin rash in rats. The toxicity in these models is clearlyimmune mediated. In other models, such as amodiaquine-inducedagranulocytosis/hepatotoxicity and halothane-induced hepatotoxicity, the druginduces an immune response but there is no clinical toxicity. This findingsuggests that regulatory mechanisms usually limit toxicity. Many of the basiccharacteristics of the penicillamine and nevirapine models, such as memory andtolerance, are quite different suggesting that the mechanisms are alsosignificantly different. More animal models are needed to study the range ofmechanisms involved in DHRs; without them, progress in understanding suchreactions is likely to be slow.",16594644,16594644

The effect ofmicrosphere coating as well its drying procedure on the Hb release profile wasalso evaluated. Chitosan coating was applied by either a continuousmicroencapsulation procedure or a 2-stage coating process. Microspheres with amean diameter of less than 30 microm and an encapsulation efficiency above 90%were obtained. Calcium alginate cross-linking was optimized by using anacid/CaCO(3) molar ratio of 2.5, and microsphere-recovery with acetate buffer ledto higher encapsulation efficiency. Hb release in gastric fluid was minimal forair-dried microspheres. Coating effect revealed a total release of 27% for2-stage coated wet microspheres, while other formulations showed an Hb releaseabove 50%. Lyophilized microspheres behaved similar to wet microspheres, althougha higher total protein release was obtained with 2-stage coating.

IVIGis available in limited quantities, and clinical preparations have beenassociated with the transfer of human pathogens. We have proposed that high-dosemonoclonal antibody may be used in lieu of IVIG to achieve beneficial effects inthe treatment of ITP. The current study investigates the effects of high-dosemonoclonal antibody therapy in a rat model of ITP. Hybridoma cells secreting amurine monoclonal antiplatelet antibody (7E3) and murine monoclonalanti-methotrexate IgG (AMI) were grown in serum-free media. Next, 7E3, 8 mgkg(-1), was administered intravenously to rats following pretreatment with salineor AMI (1 g kg(-1) IV). AMI and 7E3 plasma concentrations were determined viaenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and platelet count was determined with aCell-Dyne hematology analyzer. Severe, transient thrombocytopenia was induced by7E3. Platelet counts dropped to approximately 8% of initial values within 1 hourafter 7E3 administration. AMI pretreatment dramatically affected 7E3-inducedthrombocytopenia, significantly altering the time course of thrombocytopenia (P <.05) and significantly decreasing the severity of 7E3-induced thrombocytopenia(ie, following AMI pretreatment, nadir platelet count was greater than 8-foldthat of the control group, P < .05). In addition, AMI pretreatment induced a 57%increase in 7E3 clearance (1.13 +/- 0.13 mL h(-1) kg(-1) vs 0.72 +/- 0.08 mLh(-1) kg(-1), P < .05).

These advances are illustrated byresults from our ongoing work on the actions of hallucinogens on serotonin (5-HT)receptors. We show how a combined computational and experimental approach canreveal specific modes of receptor activation underlying the difference inproperties of hallucinogens compared with nonhallucinogenic congeners. Thesemodes of activation-that can produce distinct ligand-dependent receptorstates-are identified in terms of structural motifs (SM) in molecular models ofthe receptors, which were shown to constitute conserved functional microdomains(FM). The role of several SM/FMs in the activation mechanism of the GPCRs ispresented in detail to illustrate how this mechanism can lead to ligand-dependentmodes of signaling by the receptors. Novel bioinformatics tools are describedthat were designed to support the quantitative mathematical modeling ofligand-specific signaling pathways activated by the 5-HT receptors targeted byhallucinogens. The approaches for mathematical modeling of signaling pathwaysactivated by 5-HT receptors are described briefly in the context of ongoing workon detailed biochemical models of 5-HT2A, and combined 5-HT2A/5-HT1A,receptor-mediated activation of the MAPK 1,2 pathway.

Evidence is mounting thatproducts of the immune system, such as chemokines, can reciprocally alter theactions of these drugs and the endogenous ligands for their receptors. Chemokinesare a family of small (8 to 12 kDa) proteins involved in cellular migration andintercellular communication. With a few exceptions, they act on more than onereceptor. Although the chemokines and their G protein-coupled receptors arelocated in both glia and neurons throughout the brain, they are not uniformlydistributed. They are found in such brain areas as the hypothalamus, nucleusaccumbens, limbic system, hippocampus, thalamus, cortex, and cerebellum. Amongthe chemokines differentially localized in brain neurons and glia are CCL2/MCP-1,CXCL12/SDF-1alpha, CX3CL1/fractalkine, CXCL10/IP 10, CCL3/MIP-1alpha, andCCL5/RANTES. Functional roles for the chemokine system, composed of the chemokineligands and their receptors, have been suggested in brain development andheterologous desensitization. The system can alter the actions of neuronallyactive pharmacological agents such as opioids and cannabinoids and interact withneurotransmitter systems. In this review, we propose that the endogenouschemokine system in the brain acts in concert with the neurotransmitter andneuropeptide systems to govern brain function. It can thus be thought of as thethird major system in the brain.",16594639,16594639

Although adverse effects of cannabinoids in femalereproduction have been implicated for years, the mechanisms by which they exertthese effects remained elusive. With the identification of cannabinoid receptors,endocannabinoid ligands, their key synthetic and hydrolytic pathways, and thegeneration of knockout mouse models for cannabinoid receptors, a wealth ofinformation is now available regarding the significance ofcannabinoid/endocannabinoid signaling in early pregnancy. This review focuses onvarious aspects of endocannabinoid signaling in preimplantation embryodevelopment and activation, and uterine differentiation during theperiimplantation embryo-uterine dialog. It is hoped that a deeper understandingwill lead to potential clinical applications of the endocannabinoid system as atarget for regulating female fertility.",16808046,16808046
7084787977243506621,16808045,The AAPS journal,Hannigan JH,"Organic solvents have become ubiquitous in our environment and are essential forindustry. Many women of reproductive age are increasingly exposed to solventssuch as toluene in occupational settings (ie, long-term, low-concentrationexposures) or through inhalant abuse (eg, episodic, binge exposures to highconcentrations). The risk for teratogenic outcome is much less with low tomoderate occupational solvent exposure compared with the greater potential foradverse pregnancy outcomes, developmental delays, and neurobehavioral problems inchildren born to women exposed to high concentrations of abused organic solventssuch as toluene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, xylenes, and nitrous oxide. Yet theteratogenic effects of abuse patterns of exposure to toluene and other inhalantsremain understudied. We briefly review how animal models can aid substantially inclarifying the developmental risk of exposure to solvents for adversebiobehavioral outcomes following abuse patterns of use and in the absence ofassociated health problems and co-drug abuse (eg, alcohol). Our studies alsobegin to establish the importance of dose (concentration) and critical perinatalperiods of exposure to specific outcomes. The present results with our clinicallyrelevant animal model of repeated, brief, high-concentration binge prenataltoluene exposure demonstrate the dose-dependent effect of toluene on prenataldevelopment, early postnatal maturation, spontaneous exploration, andamphetamine-induced locomotor activity. The results imply that abuse patterns oftoluene exposure may be more deleterious than typical occupational exposure onfetal development and suggest that animal models are effective in studying themechanisms and risk factors of organic solvent teratogenicity.",16808045,16808045

More than 2.5 decades ago, METH-induced damage todopaminergic neurons was described. Since then, numerous advancements have beenmade in the search for the underlying mechanisms whereby METH causes thesepersistent dopaminergic deficits. Although our understanding of these mechanismsremains incomplete, combinations of various complex processes have been describedaround a central theme involving reactive species, such as reactive oxygen and/ornitrogen species (ROS and RNS, respectively). For example, METH-inducedhyperthermia, aberrant dopamine(DA), or glutamate transmission; or mitochondrialdisruption leads to the generation of reactive species with neurotoxicconsequences.

Based upon saturationkinetics, these early reports have proposed that 2-AG enters the cell by aspecific 2-AG transporter, via the putative anandamide transporter, or by simplediffusion. In this review, the uptake of 2-AG is discussed in light of the recentadvances that have been made for anandamide transport, where the mechanismappears to be rate-limited diffusion through the membrane.

Several dried sucralfate gels were compared withhumid sucralfate gel and sucralfate nongel powder in terms of neutralization rateand buffering capacity. Humid sucralfate gel and microwave-dried gel exhibitedantacid effectiveness. In particular, the neutralization rate of dried gelpowders was inversely related to the water content: as the water content of driedpowders decreased, the acid reaction rate linearly increased. The relationshipwas due to the different morphology of dried sucralfate gels. In fact, theporosity of the dried samples increased with the water reduction. However, theacid neutralization equivalent revealed that the dried sucralfate gel became moreresistant to acid attack in the case of water content below 42%. Then, themicrowave drying procedure had the opposite effect on the reactivity of thealuminum hydroxide component of dried sucralfate gel powders, since the rate ofthe reaction increased whereas the buffering capacity decreased as the amount ofwater was reduced.",16584168,16584168

Sumatriptan microemulsions (SME)/sumatriptan succinatemicroemulsions (SSME) were prepared using titration method and characterized fordrug content, globule size and size distribution, and zeta potential.Biodistribution of SME, SSME, sumatriptan solution (SSS), and marketed product(SMP) in the brain and blood of Swiss albino rats following intranasal andintravenous (IV) administrations were examined using optimized technetium-labeled((99m)Tc-labeled) ST formulations. The pharmacokinetic parameters, drug targetingefficiency (DTE), and direct drug transport (DTP) were derived. Gammascintigraphy imaging of rat brain following IV and intranasal administrationswere performed to ascertain the localization of drug. SME and SSME weretransparent and stable with mean globule size 38 +/- 20 nm and zeta potentialbetween -35 to -55 mV. Brain/blood uptake ratios at 0.5 hour following IVadministration of SME and intranasal administrations of SME, SMME, and SSS werefound to be 0.20, 0.50, 0.60, and 0.26, respectively, suggesting effectivetransport of drug following intranasal administration of microemulsions. HigherDTE and DTP for mucoadhesive microemulsions indicated more effective targetingfollowing intranasal administration and best brain targeting of ST frommucoadhesive microemulsions. Rat brain scintigraphy endorsed higher uptake of STinto the brain. Studies conclusively demonstrated rapid and larger extent oftransport of microemulsion of ST compared with microemulsion of SS, SMP, and SSSinto the rat brain. Hence, intranasal delivery of ST microemulsion developed inthis investigation can play a promising role in the treatment of acute attacks ofmigraine.",16584167,16584167

The changes in surface structure were reflected bygloss variation, which was measured using a diffractive optical element-basedglossmeter (DOG). By scanning a surface area, we constructed a 2-dimensionalgloss map that characterized the tablet's surface structure. The gloss variationresults were compared with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and averagesurface roughness values that were measured by conventional diamond stylusprofilometry. The profilometry data showed a decrease in tablet surface roughnessas a function of compression force. In general, a smoother surface contributes tohigher average gloss values. The average gloss values for this material, incontrast, showed a decrease as a function of the compression force. The sequenceof particle fragmentation and deformation together with crack formation in sodiumchloride particles resulted in a loss of gloss for single sodium chlorideparticles at the tablet surfaces, which could be detected by the DOG. Theseresults were supported by the SEM images. The results show that detailedinformation regarding tablets' surface structure changes can be obtained bydetection of local gloss variation and average gloss.",16584166,16584166

Theformulations were injected using the dynamic injection apparatus into a flowingstream of isotonic Sorensen's phosphate buffer at rates of 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2mL/min. The peaks obtained with the spectrophotometer were reproducible for eachinjection rate/formulation combination. For the phosphate-buffered formulation,the least amount of precipitation was obtained at the 0.25 mL/min injection rate.Acetate buffer was able to substantially reduce such precipitation, even at thehighest injection rate. The opacity peaks for the formulation with the acetateaddition were significantly smaller (P < .05) than those obtained for theunaltered formulation at all 4 injection rates. The results suggest that acetateis a better buffer species than phosphate for the pH range defined. Furthermore,we present evidence to support a generally applicable approach to screening newformulations of drug products that may be clinically useful for reducing theincidence of phlebitis in humans.",16584164,16584164

Tablets were preparedby direct compression and evaluated for bioadhesive strength and in vitrodissolution parameters. A central composite design for 2 factors at 3 levels eachwas employed to systematically optimize drug release profile and bioadhesivestrength. Carbopol 934P and sodium carboxymethylcellulose were taken as theindependent variables. Response surface plots and contour plots were drawn, andoptimum formulations were selected by feasibility and grid searches. Compressedmatrices exhibited non-Fickian drug release kinetics approaching zero-order, asthe value of release rate exponent (n) varied between 0.6672 and 0.8646,resulting in regulated and complete release until 24 hours. Both the polymers hadsignificant effect on the bioadhesive strength of the tablets, measured as forceof detachment against porcine gastric mucosa (P < .001). Polynomial mathematicalmodels, generated for various response variables using multiple linear regressionanalysis, were found to be statistically significant (P < .01). Validation ofoptimization study, performed using 8 confirmatory runs, indicated very highdegree of prognostic ability of response surface methodology, with meanpercentage error (+/- SD) as -0.0072 +/- 1.087.

The SLN formulationparticle size was determined using Photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) andlaser diffraction analysis (LD). The change of particle charge was studied byzeta potential (ZP) measurements, while the melting and recrystallizationbehavior was studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In vitrorelease studies of the essential oil were performed at 35 degrees C. Data showeda high physical stability for both formulations at various storage temperaturesduring 2 months of investigation. In particular, average diameter of Artemisiaarborescens L essential oil-loaded SLN did not vary during storage and increasedslightly after spraying the SLN dispersions.

Release kinetics wasevaluated by using United States Pharmacopeia (USP)-22 type I dissolutionapparatus. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize the effect ofdissolution medium on matrix tablet surface. Furthermore, the in vitro and invivo newly formulated sustained-release zidovudine tablets were compared withconventional marketed tablet (Zidovir, Cipla Ltd, Mumbai, India). The in-vitrodrug release study revealed that either Eudragit preparation was able to sustainthe drug release only for 6 hours (94.3% +/- 4.5% release). Combining Eudragitwith ethyl cellulose sustained the drug release for 12 hours (88.1% +/- 4.1%release). Fitting the in vitro drug release data to Korsmeyer equation indicatedthat diffusion along with erosion could be the mechanism of drug release. In vivoinvestigation in rabbits showed sustained-release pharmacokinetic profile ofzidovudine from the matrix tablets formulated using combination of Eudragits andethylcellulose.

The proposed scale-up rules are based on a macroscopicevaluation of the coating process. Implementation of these rules does not requirecomplex experimentation or prediction of model parameters. The proposed scale-uprules were tested by conducting coating scale-up and scale-down experiments on24-inch and 52-inch Vector Hi-coaters. The data demonstrate that using theserules led to similar cumulative drug release profiles (f2 >> 50; and P Analysisof Variance [PANOVA] >> 0.05 for cumulative percentage of drug released after 12hours [Cum12]) from tablets made at 24- and 52-inch scales. Membranecharacteristics such as opacity and roughness were also similar across the 2scales. The effects of the key process variables on coat weight uniformity andmembrane characteristics were also studied. Pan speed was found to be the mostsignificant factor related to coating uniformity.

The vial heat transfer coefficients (Kv) were calculated fromthe MTM-determined temperature and resistance and compared with Kv valuesdetermined by a gravimetric method. The differences between the MTM vial heattransfer coefficients and the gravimetric values are large at low shelftemperature but smaller when higher shelf temperatures were used. The differencesalso became smaller at higher chamber pressure and smaller when higher resistancematerials were being freeze-dried. In all cases, using thermal shields greatlyimproved the accuracy of the MTM Kv measurement. With use of thermal shields, thethickness of the frozen layer calculated from MTM is in good agreement withvalues obtained gravimetrically. The heat transfer coefficient ""error"" is largelya direct result of the error in the dry layer resistance (ie, MTM-determinedresistance is too low). This problem can be minimized if thermal shields are usedfor freeze-drying. With suitable use of thermal shields, accurate Kv values areobtained by MTM; thus allowing accurate calculations of heat and mass flow rates.The extent of primary drying can be monitored by real-time calculation of theamount of remaining ice using MTM data, thus providing a process analytical toolthat greatly improves the freeze-drying process design and control.",17285746,17285746

The focus was on crystallization, Tg' (glasstransition temperature of the maximally freeze-concentrated phase), and Tc(collapse temperature). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), cryomicroscopy,and low-temperature x-ray powder diffraction (LTXRD) were used to study thefrozen state. In mannitol-HSA formulations, mannitol crystallization wasinhibited and Tg' lowered to a greater extent by stabilized HSA (containingNa-octanoate, Na-N-acetyltryptophanate, and NaCl) than by unstabilized HSA.Detailed DSC and LTXRD studies showed that in the concentrations used forstabilizing HSA, NaCl led to changes in the freezing behavior, an effect that wasless pronounced for the other stabilizers. NaCl further lowered the Tc, which wasdetermined by cryomicroscopy.

The MTM resistance values were compared with the resistance valuesobtained using the ""vial method."" The product dry-layer resistances obtained byMTM, assuming fixed temperature difference (DeltaT; 2 degrees C), were lower thanthe actual values, especially when the product temperatures and sublimation rateswere low, but with DeltaT determined from the pressure rise data, more accurateresults were obtained. MTM resistance values were generally lower than the valuesobtained with the vial method, particularly whenever freeze-drying was conductedunder conditions that produced large variations in product temperature (ie, lowshelf temperature, low chamber pressure, and without thermal shields). In anexperiment designed to magnify temperature heterogeneity, MTM resistance valueswere much lower than the simple average of the product resistances. However, inexperiments where product temperatures were homogenous, good agreement betweenMTM and ""vial-method"" resistances was obtained. The reason for the low MTMresistance problem is the fast vapor pressure rise from a few ""warm"" edge vialsor vials with low resistance.

The nanoparticulate dispersion and its gels were evaluated forvarious parameters such as particle size, in vitro drug release, in vitropenetration, in vivo skin hydration, and skin irritation. The solid lipidnanoparticulate dispersion showed mean particle size of 350 nm. Differentialscanning calorimetry studies revealed no drug-excipient incompatibility. In vitrorelease profile of vitamin A palmitate from nanoparticulate dispersion and itsgel showed prolonged drug release up to 24 hours, which could be owing toembedment of drug in the solid lipid core.

In the first patient, who presented with fever, malaise, and weight loss18 months after LC, abdominal US revealed hypoechoic focal lesions containinghyperechoic images with posterior shadowing of the liver and spleen. US-guidedaspiration biopsies of these lesions yielded purulent material, and the injectionand aspiration of saline solution provoked rolling movements of the hyperechoicimages. Laparotomy confirmed the diagnosis of abscess-containing spilledgallstones. In the second patient, multiple hyperechoic images with posteriorshadowing were observed in the Morison pouch during a routine US examination. Thediagnosis of retained stones was consistent with the history of gallstonespillage during LC performed 2 months previously and was confirmed by computedtomographic findings of hyperdense images in the Morison pouch.

METHODS: Forty-fiveconsecutive patients with suspected small bowel disorder were studied. Allpatients underwent abdominal ultrasound before and after infusion of an isotonicnonabsorbable electrolyte solution containing polyethylene glycol through anasojejunal tube (modified Billbao Dotter tube), and images at various levelswere obtained. Small bowel wall thickness, luminal narrowing, intestinaldilatation, peristalsis, and extraintestinal complications were noted. It wasfollowed by barium enteroclysis and findings were recorded. Findings ofsonoenteroclysis were compared with those of barium enteroclysis. RESULTS:Satisfactory distention of the intestinal lumen was obtained with sequentialvisualization of jejunoileal loops in 34.4 +/- 18.4 min. Of 45 patients, 10showed normal small bowel on sonoenteroclysis and barium enteroclysis. These 10patients served as controls. Sonoenteroclysis displayed normal diameters smallerthan 3.0 and 2.0 cm for the jejunum and ileum, respectively. Bowel wall thicknesswas 1.7 to 3.0 mm and all five layers of bowel wall could be well appreciated.Valvulae conniventes were clearly visualized with a fold thickness between 1.4and 2.0 mm. The remaining 35 patients showed abnormalities in the form ofstrictures, matted bowel loops, dilated loops, thickened folds, deformedileocecal junction, mass lesions, etc., on sonoenteroclysis and bariumenteroclysis. In addition, sonoenteroclysis showed thickened bowel wall with lossof stratification. Extraintestinal findings such as enlarged lymph nodes andascites were also disclosed at the time of sonography. These were diagnosedsubsequently as cases of tuberculosis (n = 23), celiac disease (n = 6),adenocarcinoma (n = 2), leiomyoma (n = 2), Immunoproliferative small intestinaldisease (n = 1), and segmental enteritis (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosticaccuracy of sonoenteroclysis for detecting small bowel lesions is comparable tothat of barium enteroclysis. This new, widely available, inexpensive, andundemanding technique can be used as an initial investigation in the evaluationof patients with small bowel disorders.",16447095,16447095

Five of 12 cases of seeding were observed as a complication of 1080PAT procedures (0.46%) performed in 545 patients (0.96%) by two of the authors(L.T., G.F.) over a long period (15 years) at different institutions. The otherseven patients had been treated with PAT procedures at other institutions and hadcome to our attention during post-treatment follow-up. RESULTS: The 12 patientswho had seeding nodules had undergone the following PAT procedures: multisessionconventional percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) without anesthesia (fourpatients), single-session PEI with general anesthesia (three patients),single-session PEI with general anesthesia plus multisession conventional PEI(four patients), and single-session PEI plus radiofrequency ablation (onepatient). Seeding nodules ranged from 0.9 to 6.0 cm (mean 1.7 cm). Eleven of 12seeding nodules appeared as hypervascular hypoechoic nodules with smooth andregular margins and multiple intralesional vascular signals. CONCLUSIONS:Clinical and imaging findings of seeding from HCC should be recognized byphysicians who perform follow-up ultrasound examinations of patients who aretreated with PAT. Early diagnosis of seeding can be reliably made by scanning theabdominal wall with small probes in the area where the previous PAT has beenperformed. Hypoechoic hypervascular pattern of the seeding nodule allowsdefinitive diagnosis.",16333710,16333710

METHODS: From a series of 253consecutive lesions that were indeterminate on baseline ultrasound and thenscanned after injection of air-filled microbubble contrast agent, 65 focal liverlesions were retrospectively selected on the basis of a diagnosis of liverhemangioma on multiphase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (n = 23), magneticresonance imaging (n = 27), or histology (n = 15). Each lesion was scanned duringarterial phase (30 s after microbubble injection) and late phase (5 min afterinjection).

We evaluated the radiologicfindings of autoimmune pancreatitis. METHODS: Computed tomographic, magneticresonance imaging, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographic, andultrasonographic findings of 20 patients with autoimmune pancreatitis in ourhospital between November 2000 and December 2003 were retrospectively reviewedregarding changes and ancillary findings in the pancreatic parenchyma, the mainpancreatic duct, peripancreatic vessels, and distal common bile duct. Inaddition, follow-up images were reviewed for changes in any abnormality seen onthe initial examinations. RESULTS: Pancreatic parenchymal enlargement wasinvariably seen that was diffuse (n = 19) or focal (n = 1), with homogeneouscontrast enhancement on computed tomography (n = 20) and magnetic resonanceimaging (n = 15). Capsule-like rim enhancement was seen in six patients. Therewas focal (n = 18) or diffuse (n = 2) narrowing of the main pancreatic duct andit was usually multifocal (n = 17) in the former. Narrowing of the peripancreaticveins was seen in 14 patients. There was tapered (n = 15) or abrupt (n = 3)narrowing of the distal common bile duct in 18 patients, with contrastenhancement of the narrowed segment in eight. Invariably, changes in thepancreatic parenchyma, main pancreatic duct, peripancreatic vessels, and commonbile duct were normalized on follow-up studies after steroid therapy. CONCLUSION:In this series, common radiologic findings of autoimmune pancreatitis were (a)diffuse pancreas enlargement, (b) multifocal narrowing of the main pancreaticduct, (c) narrowing of peripancreatic veins, and (d) tapered narrowing of thedistal common bile duct with frequent contrast enhancement.

MR images (n = 22), CT during arterial portography (n = 20),and CT hepatic arteriography (n = 17) were retrospectively correlatedquantitatively and qualitatively with VEGF expression in HCCs and in thesurrounding liver assessed by western blotting. HCC-to-liver contrast-to-noiseratio correlated with VEGF expression index (VEGF(IND)) values of HCCs inverselyon opposed-phase, T1-weighted, spoiled gradient recalled-echo (GRE) images,directly on T2-weighted, fast spin-echo images, and marginally and inversely ongadolinium-enhanced hepatic arterial-phase GRE images. On T2-weighted fastspin-echo images, standard deviation ratio of HCCs correlated directly withVEGF(IND) values of HCCs. By CT hepatic arteriography, the contrast-enhancementindex of HCCs showed a moderate inverse correlation with VEGF(IND) values ofHCCs, and the contrast-enhancement index of the liver showed marginal, moderatedirect correlation with VEGF(IND) values in the liver. Heterogeneities of HCCs onimages correlated directly with VEGF(IND) values of HCCs on opposed-phaseT1-weighted GRE images, T2-weighted fast spin-echo images, hepatic arterial-phaseGRE images, equilibrium-phase GRE images, and CT hepatic arteriogram. Our resultsmay reflect that MR signal intensity, hepatic arterial vascularity, andheterogeneity of HCCs on CT or MR images are closely related to the intensity ofVEGF expression in HCC as upregulated by hyper- or hypoxia in HCCs. Although thereal effects of our results on radiologic practice are debatable at this moment,we believe that our results may help future radiologic practice in conjunctionwith biomolecular or genetic treatment for HCCs.",16317488,16317488

METHODS: In vitro studies, wereperformed initially to evaluate the imaging characteristics of multiplesolutions. These studies resulted in two solutions being compared with thepresently accepted oral CT agents of dilute iodinated contrast and water.Ninety-eight consecutive subjects already scheduled for routine outpatientabdominal-pelvic CT were enrolled. Subjects were randomized to water (n = 30),fiber solution (n = 32), polyethylene glycol (PEG; n = 11), or dilute iodinatedsolution (DI; n = 25). Examinations were then evaluated for gastric distention,small bowel distention, small bowel wall visualization, and colonic transit. Aquestionnaire was given to the study subjects for feedback concerning taste andpotential side effects from these agents. RESULTS: PEG tended to provide betterbowel distention, wall visualization, and colonic transit compared with water,fiber solution, and DI. Areas of statistical significance included: (1) averagebowel diameter in the left upper quadrant for water was 17.50 mm, whereas thatfor PEG was 21.88 mm (p < 0.05); (2) average bowel diameter in the pelvis forwater was 14.79 mm, that for fiber was 15.67 mm, and that for PEG was 18.48 mm (p< 0.05); (3) wall visualization was better with PEG than with fiber (p < 0.05);(4) successful transit of contrast to the colon occurred in every subject whoreceived PEG compared with only 20% of those received water and 39% of those whoreceived fiber (p < 0.05).

ED visits resulting from injuries involving sleds,snow discs, snow tubes, and toboggans were analyzed for patients 19 years of ageor younger. RESULTS: In 2001/2002, there were an estimated 57,866 ED visits forsledding-related injuries in the United States for all age groups. Of these,41,272 (71%) occurred in patients 19 years of age or younger, 58% of whom weremale. The highest number of injuries occurred in children between five and 14years of age (74%), and the injuries were most often caused by falls orcollisions (75%). The head or neck was the most frequently injured body regionamong those 0-9 years of age, while the extremities were injured most commonlyamong those 10-19 years of age. Head and neck injuries occurred in 56% (95%confidence interval [CI] = 32% to 81%) of children 0-4 years of age versus 19%(95% CI = 9% to 29%) of patients 15-19 years of age.

Previous investigators have demonstrated the benefit oflipid emulsion therapy in ameliorating toxicity from lipid-soluble agents. Theauthors investigated the effect of Intralipid treatment in a rat model ofverapamil toxicity. METHODS: Thirty sedated Wistar rats were infused withverapamil at 37.5 mg/kg/h. Five minutes after the start of infusion, animals weretreated with a bolus of either 12.4 mL/kg 20% Intralipid or 12.4 mL/kg 0.9%saline. Verapamil infusion was continued until the animals were killed.Respiratory rate, heart rate, and electrocardiography were sampled every 2.5minutes throughout. RESULTS: Survival was prolonged in the Intralipid-treatedgroup (44 +/- 21 vs. 24 +/- 9 minutes; p = 0.003). The median lethal dose wasincreased in the Intralipid group (25.7 mg/kg [95% confidence interval {CI} =24.7 to 26.7] vs. 13.6 mg/kg [95% CI = 12.2 to 15.0]). A less marked decrease inheart rate was observed during verapamil infusion in the Intralipid-treated group(6.8 beats/min [95% CI = 8.3 to 5.2] for Intralipid vs. 10.7 beats/min [95% CI =12.6 to 8.9] for saline; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Intralipid treatment prolongssurvival and doubles median lethal dose in a rat model of verapamil toxicity. Themechanism of action remains to be elucidated.",16436797,16436797
7084787977243506621,16436796,Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic,Tucker JA,"OBJECTIVES: Modafinil has recently been approved for the treatment of shift worksleep disorder, making it potentially available for shift-working emergencyphysicians. The authors' objectives were to determine whether modafinil improvedcognitive performance of emergency physicians following overnight shifts and torecord symptoms and subjective evaluations of the effect of modafinil on theparticipants. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlledcrossover study that followed CONSORT guidelines. Participants were assigned toone of two study groups, with study sessions occurring at least seven weeksapart, and received either modafinil or placebo depending on their randomallocation. Testing after night shifts included a coding task and an AX versionof the Continuous Performance Task, both of which test cognitive function.Participants also completed visual analog scales for three subjective outcomes,and symptoms were elicited. RESULTS: Modafinil facilitated performance on longinterstimulus-interval AX trials (F [1, 23] = 6.65, p = 0.1) and marginallyreduced errors on AY trials in the Continuous Performance Task (F [1, 23] = 3.59,p = 0.07), suggesting facilitation of sustained attention, cognitive control, andworking memory. Additionally, modafinil, compared with placebo, facilitatedperformance on the coding task at the first session. Subjective data from visualanalog scales confirmed that modafinil increased perceived alertness during thesimulated patient care sessions but worsened sleep onset when opportunities forsleep arose. CONCLUSIONS: Modafinil increased certain aspects of cognitivefunction and subjectively improved participants' ability to attendpost-night-shift didactic sessions but made it more difficult for participants tofall asleep when opportunities for sleep arose.",16436796,16436796
7084787977243506621,16436795,Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic,Kuhn GJ,"OBJECTIVES: To characterize emergency medicine (EM) program directors (PDs) andcompare the data, where possible, with those from other related publishedstudies. METHODS: An online survey was e-mailed in 2002 to all EM PDs of programsthat were approved by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education.The survey included questions concerning demographics, work hours, support staff,potential problems and solutions, salary and expenses, and satisfaction. RESULTS:One hundred nine of 124 (88%) PDs (69.7% university, 27.5% community, and 2.8%military) completed the survey; 85.3% were male. Mean age was 43.6 years (95%confidence interval [CI] = 42.6 to 44.7 yr). The mean time as a PD was 5.7 years(95% CI = 4.9 to 6.5 yr), with 56% serving five years or less. The mean timeexpected to remain as PD is an additional 6.0 years (95% CI = 5.2 to 6.8). A 1995study noted that 50% of EM PDs had been in the position for less than threeyears, and 68% anticipated continuing in their position for less than five years.On a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 as highest), the mean satisfaction with theposition of PD was 8.0 (95% CI = 7.2 to 8.3). Those PDs who stated that theprevious PD had mentored them planned to stay a mean of 2.0 years longer than didthose who were not mentored (95% CI of difference of means = 0.53 to 3.53).Sixty-five percent of PDs had served previously as an associate PD. Most PDs(92%) have an associate or assistant PD, with 54% reporting one; 25%, two; and9%, three associate or assistant PDs. A 1995 study noted that 62% had anassociate PD. Ninety-two percent have a program coordinator, and 35% stated thatthey have both a residency secretary and a program coordinator. Program directorsworked a median of 195 hours per month: clinical, 75 hours; scholarly activity,20 hours; administrative, 80 hours; and teaching and residency conferences, 20hours; compared with a median total hours of 220 previously reported. Lack ofadequate time to do the job required, career needs interfering with family needs,and lack of adequate faculty help with residency matters were identified as themost important problems (means of 3.5 [95% CI = 3.2 to 3.7], 3.4 [95% CI = 3.2 to3.6], and 3.1 [95% CI = 2.9 to 3.3], respectively, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5as maximum). This study identified multiple resources that were found to beuseful by >50% of PDs, including national meetings, lectures, advice from others,and self-study. CONCLUSIONS: Emergency medicine PDs generally are very satisfiedwith the position of PD, perhaps because of increased support and resources.Although PD turnover remains an issue, PDs intend to remain in the position for alonger period of time than noted before this study. This may reflect the overallsatisfaction with the position as well as the increased resources and support nowavailable to the PD. PDs have greater satisfaction if they have been mentored forthe position.",16436795,16436795

The authors sought to examine the effectof glycemic control on mortality after acute stroke. METHODS: This was aretrospective study of patients discharged with a diagnosis of ischemic strokeduring a 40-month period from a large urban U.S. health system. Patients werecompared by initial blood glucose (BG) levels and by glycemic control during thefirst 48 hours of hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 960 patients with thromboembolicstroke, 373 (38.9%) were hyperglycemic (BG > or = 130 mg/dL) on hospitaladmission. Admission hyperglycemia was associated with a higher mortality ratethan was euglycemia (odds ratio [OR] = 3.15; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.45to 6.85; p = 0.004). Persistent hyperglycemia (PerHyp) during 48 hours ofhospitalization was associated with even higher mortality rate (unadjustedlogistic regression, OR = 6.54; 95% CI = 2.41 to 17.87; p < 0.001). Glycemiccontrol (normalization of BG to < 130 mg/dL) was associated with a 4.6-folddecrease in mortality risk as compared with the case of patients with PerHyp (p <0.001). Multiple logistic regression showed glycemic control to be a strongindependent determinant of survival (OR = 5.95; 95% CI = 1.24 to 28.6; p = 0.026)after acute stroke even after adjustment for age, gender, concomitanthypertension and diabetes, and stroke severity. CONCLUSIONS: Admissionhyperglycemia is associated with a worse outcome after stroke than is euglycemia.Normalization of blood glucose during the first 48 hours of hospitalizationappears to confer a potent survival benefit in patients with thromboembolicstroke.",16436794,16436794
7084787977243506621,16436793,Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic,Beltram M,"OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have reported that pain is undertreated in theemergency department (ED), but few physician-dependent risk factors have beenidentified. In this study, the authors determine whether pain treatment andrelief in ED patients are negatively associated with the physician's perceptionof whether the patient was exaggerating symptoms, and with the patient andphysician's perceptions of the interaction between them, as well as whetherdemographic characteristics were associated with these perceptions. METHODS: Thiswas a prospective observational study of patients who were undergoing treatmentfor painful disorders in the ED. Before treatment for pain, patients were askedto complete a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) describing their pain. Demographicinformation and pain treatments administered were recorded. Patients completed asecond pain VAS before discharge from the ED. Patients were then asked tocomplete three queries describing their perception of their interaction with thephysician. After the patient had left the department, the patient's physician wasasked to complete a query describing his or her perception of the interaction andto complete a VAS describing how likely it was that the patient was exaggeratingsymptoms to obtain pain medicines for nonmedical purposes. RESULTS: There were1,695 patients enrolled in the study; 32 patients were excluded because ofmissing or incomplete data, leaving 1,663 for analysis. Of these patients, 71.9%received a pain medication while in the ED. There was no association between thephysician's VAS for perceived exaggeration of symptoms, the queries describingphysician-patient interactions, and patient ethnicity and whether patientsreceived pain treatment in the ED. There was a negative correlation between thephysician's VAS for perceived exaggeration of symptoms and the change in thepatient's pre- and posttreatment pain VAS scores. The physician's VAS score forperceived exaggeration of symptoms was higher among Native American patients thanamong other ethnic groups (p < or = 0.001). The patient and physician queriesrating their interaction show a decreased absolute reduction of VAS pain scores(p > or = 0.001) and a reduction in the number of patients having at least a 50%reduction in their pain VAS score when interactions were rated ""bad"" and ""verybad"" (p < or = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The physician's perception of whether apatient was exaggerating symptoms was associated with the patient's ethnicbackground and with both the physician's and patient's perception of theirinteraction. These perceptions were negatively associated with the achievement ofpain relief and the change in the patient's pain VAS scores, but not with whethera patient was treated with a pain medication.",16436793,16436793
7084787977243506621,16436792,Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic,Mehta SD,"OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to examine how physicians in the emergencydepartment ask questions of patients presenting with chest pain and whether thisvaries by patient demographics. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study withconvenience sampling. A survey was administered to adult emergency departmentpatients presenting with chest pain after emergency physicians obtained thehistory and performed the physical examination. No identifying data werecollected from the patients. In addition to demographics, patients were askedwhether or not their physician asked them about factors related to coronarysyndrome and myocardial infarction etiology. RESULTS: A total of 308 of 332patients (93%) participated. Patients had a mean age of 52 years, 54% were male,and 85% spoke English; classification by race was 31% African American, 28%white, 19% Hispanic, and 13% other. History taking did not differ by gender.Patients who reported being asked about the following were statisticallysignificantly younger than those who reported not being asked: family history,other medical problems, smoking, cocaine use, and alcohol use. Nonwhite patientsreported being asked about the following more frequently than white patients:smoking (94% vs. 84%), alcohol use (81% vs. 70%), and cocaine use (64% vs. 42%).In multivariate logistic regression controlling for age, nonwhite patients weremore likely than white patients to be asked about smoking (odds ratio [OR], 2.79;95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.26 to 6.19), cocaine use (OR, 2.49; 95% CI =1.50 to 4.12), and alcohol use (OR, 1.77; 95% CI = 1.0 to 3.09). CONCLUSIONS: Thevariability in questions about behavioral factors associated with chest painetiology as reported by patients may indicate a possible cultural bias byphysicians. Differences in risk identification may lead to differences intreatment decisions.",16436792,16436792
7084787977243506621,16436791,Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic,Guerin R,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the accuracy of diagnostic interpretation of radiographsby pediatric emergency physicians (EPs) before and after the introduction of aPicture Archiving and Communications System (PACS). METHODS: The pre-PACS studyperiod included results from September 2001, when patients were evaluated byusing only conventional radiographs. The post-PACS study period consisted ofresults from September 2002, when patients were evaluated by using only digitalradiographic studies. During these periods, consecutive medical records of allpatients who underwent radiological studies when attending the pediatricemergency department (ED) were reviewed. The radiographic interpretation by thepediatric EP, documented at the time of the ED visit, was compared with that madeby the pediatric radiologist. RESULTS: Data were available from 1,644/1,651 setsof conventional radiographs ordered for the pre-PACS study period and from1,430/1,431 sets of digital radiographic studies for the post-PACS study period.The prevalence of positive radiological studies as per the radiologists was 32.2%(pre-PACS study period) vs. 28.7% (post-PACS study period). Diagnosticperformance of the pediatric EPs for the two time periods was as follows: overallaccuracy, 98.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 94.5% to 100%) vs. 98.5% (95% CI= 87.5% to 100%); sensitivity, 96.4% (95% CI = 94.5% to 97.8%) vs. 98.1% (95% CI= 96.2% to 99.2%); specificity, 98.9% (95% CI = 98.1% to 99.4%) vs. 98.6% (95% CI= 97.7% to 99.3%); negative predictive value, 98.3% (95% CI = 97.4% to 99.0%) vs.99.2% (95% CI = 98.5% to 99.7%); and positive predictive value, 97.7% (95% CI =96.0% to 98.8%) vs. 96.6% (95% CI = 94.4% to 98.2%). The proportion of falsenegatives (FN) was 1.2% (19/1,644) vs. 0.6% (8/1,430). Only one FN patient foreach time period required immediate follow-up for a missed diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: Radiograph interpretations by pediatric EPs with digital studiesremain as accurate in comparison with assessments performed by using conventionalradiographs.",16436791,16436791
7084787977243506621,16436790,Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic,Woolfrey K,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether triage nurses ordering ankle or foot radiographsaccording to the Ottawa Ankle Rules (OAR) before physician evaluation decreasesthe length of stay for patients visiting an urgent care department. METHODS: FromJuly to September 2004, a randomized controlled trial of consecutive adultpatients with ankle or foot twisting injuries who arrived at an urgent caredepartment was conducted. Patients were included if their age was 18 years orolder and their injury had occurred within seven days. They were excluded ifthere were neurovascular deficits, limb deformities, open fractures, ornonisolated ankle or foot injuries. Patients were randomly allocated to aroentgenogram-ordering clinical pathway (intervention) or to standarddepartmental care (control). Those assigned to the intervention group had triagenurses applying the OAR, and those with positive OAR were sent for roentgenogramsbefore physician evaluation. Physicians were blinded to negative OAR nurseassessments. Investigators were blinded to group allocation. The primary outcomewas the total mean length of stay (TLOS). The secondary outcomes were patientsatisfaction (five-point ordinal scale) and the proportion willing to return tothe site for future care. Two-independent sample t-test was used to analyze theTLOS. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze satisfaction ratingsdifferences between groups. Fisher's exact test was used to analyze thewilling-to-return outcome. This study had 80% power to detect an effect size of25 minutes. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-two patients were eligible; 130 patientsgave consent and were enrolled. Three patients were then excluded, three werelost to follow-up, and one left without being seen. The intervention and controlgroups had mean TLOS of 73.0 minutes and 79.7 minutes, respectively. There was astatistically nonsignificant time difference of -6.7 minutes (95% CI = -20.9 to7.4) between groups. There were no differences in patient satisfaction ratings(p-value = 0.343) or WOR (3.8%; 95% CI = -3.3% to 11.0%). CONCLUSIONS: The use ofOAR and the ordering of roentgenograms by triage nurses before physicianevaluation for twisting ankle or foot injuries does not decrease the length ofstay in an urgent care department.",16436790,16436790
7084787977243506621,16436789,Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic,Ovbiagele B,"Stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) are increasingly common conditionsthat are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The strongestpredictor of recurrent stroke risk is an initial stroke or TIA; in fact, nearly30% of all strokes are recurrent events. It is often the emergency department(ED) physician who, while treating the initial event, has the first opportunityto initiate effective preventive strategies, including pharmacotherapy andbehavior modification. Evidence- and consensus-based guidelines are wellestablished for the use of antiplatelet medications, anticoagulants, andantihypertensives for prevention of secondary stroke. Recent evidence suggeststhat the use of statins may be associated with improved clinical outcomes afterischemic stroke. In addition, behavioral interventions, such as smokingcessation, exercise, diet, and stroke education, can help patients avoid strokerecurrence. By initiating prevention therapies during the acute stroke or TIAencounter, EPs convey the message to patients that these therapies are importantfor the prevention of recurrent events and are an essential part of thetreatment.",16436789,16436789

The coral snake is the only elapid that isnative to North America, but envenomations from non-native elapids are occurringmore commonly in this country. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacyof CSAV in the neutralization of two exotic elapid envenomations: Naja naja(Indian cobra) and Dendroaspis polylepsis (black mamba). METHODS: A randomized,blinded, placebo-controlled murine model of intraperitoneal venom injection wasemployed. Venom potency was determined in preliminary dosing studies. Studyanimals then were divided into five groups: 1) N. naja venom + CSAV, 2) N. najavenom + 0.9% normal saline (NS), 3) D. polylepsis venom + CSAV, 4) D. polylepsisvenom + NS, and 5) CSAV + NS. The venom dose was chosen to be twice the estimatedLD50. The amount of CSAV injected was ten times the amount necessary forneutralization of a 2 x LD50 dose of M. f. fulvius venom in a murine model.Statistical analysis included Fisher's exact and log-rank testing to comparesurvival rates and times. RESULTS: Preliminary studies estimated the venom LD50to be 2.58 mg/kg and 0.45 mg/kg, respectively, for the N. naja and D. polylepsis.A significant difference was shown in comparison of survival times betweenCSAV-venom groups and normal saline-venom groups despite all animals in bothtreatment and control arms dying. Animals receiving CSAV and N. naja venomsurvived (mean +/- SD) 24.4 +/- 3.0 minutes, versus 17.8 +/- 1.3 minutes in thecontrol group (p < 0.001), whereas those receiving CSAV and D. polylepsis venomsurvived 203.8 +/- 37.0 minutes versus 130.0 +/- 42.6 minutes in the controlgroup (p < 0.001). All animals in the CSAV + NS group survived to the conclusionof the study. CONCLUSIONS: When premixed with venom, CSAV increased survival timein a murine model of intraperitoneal N. naja and D. polylepsis venom injection.The clinical implications of this are unclear, given unchanged mortality rates.",16436788,16436788

The absence of hemorrhage on CT scanoften is equated with a lack of brain injury. However, observational studiesrevealing poor long-term cognitive outcome after concussion suggest that braininjury may be present despite a normal CT scan. To explore this idea further, theauthors reviewed the evidence for objective neurologic injury in humans afterconcussion, with particular emphasis on those with a normal brain CT. Thisevidence comes from studies involving brain tissue pathology, CT scanning,magnetic resonance image (MRI) scanning, serum biomarkers, formal cognitive andbalance tests, functional MRI, positron emission tomography, and single-photonemission computed tomography scanning. Each section is accompanied by technicalinformation to help the reader understand what these tests are, not to endorsetheir use clinically.

The authors sought to assess the frequency of respiratory andcardiovascular events during propofol PSA within these settings. METHODS: Thisstudy was a prospective, descriptive series of a consecutive sample of EDpatients receiving propofol for PSA at three study sites. Patients were monitoredfor PSA-related events, including predefined clinically relevant cardiovascularand respiratory events. Data collection was performed during PSA with astandardized data collection sheet unique to each site. RESULTS: Propofol wasadministered during PSA to 792 patients during the respective reporting period ateach center. Indications for sedation included dislocation reduction (38%),cardioversion (10%), fracture reduction (35%), abscess incision and drainage(8%), computed tomography imaging (2%), and tube thoracostomy (1%). Thecumulative rate of oxygen desaturation events for all study sites was 7.7% with abrief period of assisted ventilation with bag-valve mask in 3.9%. The cumulativerate of PSA-related hypotensive events was 3.5%. Increasing patient age andspecific clinical procedure were clinical variables most associated with anypropofol-related respiratory event. All PSA-related events resolved withsupportive interventions during the PSA encounter. No patients requiredendotracheal intubation, prolonged observation, or admission for PSA-relatedcomplications. CONCLUSIONS: Propofol typically confers a deep sedation experiencefor ED PSA. The most common PSA events associated with propofol are respiratoryrelated and appear consistent across these three practice settings.

METHODS: This was a retrospective case series of aprospectively maintained ED sepsis registry. Data are presented as median (25th,75th percentile). The setting was an academic tertiary ED with approximately60,000 annual patient visits. Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and anAPACHE II score > or =25 entered in an ED sepsis registry over a four-monthperiod were included. Patients who received rhAPC in the intensive care unit wereexcluded. Central venous catheterization for central venous pressure and centralvenous oxygen saturation monitoring, antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, mechanicalventilation, vasopressors, inotropes, corticosteroids, and rhAPC were initiatedby the emergency physicians and continued in the intensive care unit byintensivists. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were enrolled. Patientcharacteristics were as follows: age, 79.5 (68.0, 83.5) years; APACHE II score,31.5 (29.8, 36.0); ED length of stay, 6.5 (4.0, 10.5) hours; predicted mortality,76.7% (71.9, 86.4); and in-hospital mortality, 45.8%. All patients receivedbroad-spectrum antibiotics, 54.2% completed EGDT, 33.3% received corticosteroids,and 33.3% received rhAPC.

METHODS: For the primary analysis, articlespublished in Academic Emergency Medicine, American Journal of Emergency Medicine,Annals of Emergency Medicine, and Journal of Emergency Medicine between 1994 and2003 were reviewed by two emergency physicians trained in abstracting from theliterature. Original research was identified; case reports, case series,abstracts, and meta-analysis were excluded. Articles were classified by authorreport of extramural funding as government (public), private nonprofit(foundation), for profit (industry), or multiple. Data are reported as percentper year per journal. A secondary analysis of MEDLINE was performed to identifypublishing trends by EM investigators outside of these four journals over thesame period. RESULTS: The primary analysis identified 5,728 articles; 3,278 (57%)were considered original research, with 32% of these reporting extramuralfunding. In 1994, there were 292 articles with 28% funded (28% public, 43%foundation, 17% industry, and 12% multiple). By 2003, there were 358 articleswith 36% funded (42% public, 30% foundation, 18% industry, and 10% multiple).There was a trend toward increased extramural funding in all four journals (p =0.007), with an estimated growth of 3.6% (95% confidence interval = 1.0% to 6.3%)per year over the past decade. The primary review identified 48% of all articlespublished by EM investigators. CONCLUSIONS: Author-reported extramural fundingrates for original research have increased in the EM literature over the pastdecade. Foundations have funded the largest number of studies, with public(government) sources increasing in 2003.",16365335,16365335
7084787977243506621,16365334,Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic,Verbeek PR,"OBJECTIVES: Prehospital 12-lead electrocardiogram (PHECG) interpretation andadvance emergency department (ED) notification may improve time-to-treatmentintervals for a variety of treatment strategies to improve outcome in acutemyocardial infarction. Despite consensus guidelines recommending thisintervention, few emergency medical services (EMS) employ this. The authorssystematically reviewed the literature to report whether mortality or treatmenttime intervals improved when compared with standard care. METHODS: The authorsused the Cochrane strategy to search MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents,Dissertation Abstracts, Cochrane Library, and Index of Scientific and TechnicalProceedings. Bibliographies and grant-agency Websites were reviewed, and primaryinvestigators and industry were contacted for published and unpublished studies.Inclusion criteria included PHECG and advance ED notification versus standard EMScare; controlled trials; English only; and evaluation of treatment timeintervals, all-cause mortality, or both. Study selection was hierarchical,blinded, and independent. Agreement at each level of review was evaluated byusing a kappa statistic. Study quality was measured with a validated scale andwas interpreted by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: A total of 1,283 citationswere identified, and five studies met the inclusion criteria. The weighted kappafor selection was 0.61 (standard error [SE], 0.045) for titles, 0.63 (SE, 0.051)for abstracts, and 0.79 (SE, 0.146) for full articles. Mean study qualitymeasures by two independent reviewers were 6.0/15 and 5.5/15 (correlationcoefficient, 0.85; p = 0.06). PHECG and advance ED notification increased theweighted mean on-scene time by 1.2 minutes (95% confidence interval [95% CI] =-0.84 to 3.2). The weighted mean door-to-needle interval was shortened by 36.1minutes (95% CI = 9.3 to 63.0: range of means, 22-48 minutes vs. 50-97 minutes).One study reported all-cause mortality, with a statistically nonsignificantreduction from 15.6% to 8.4%. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with AMI, the literaturewould suggest that PHECG and advanced ED notification reduces in hospital time tofibrinolysis. One controlled trial found no difference in mortality with thisout-of-hospital intervention.",16365334,16365334

METHODS: This was a prospectiveobservational study that was conducted October 2000 through October 2001 in anurban Level 1 trauma center. There were 103 consecutive nonrandomized adulttrauma patients who required immediate tube thoracostomy during their initialresuscitation who were entered into the study. The Mac-technique test wasperformed during standard tube thoracostomy insertion to the appropriate depth.The test involved grasping the external portion of the thoracostomy tube, turningit clockwise 180 degrees, and then releasing the tube. If the tube spontaneouslyspun back to its original position, the test was considered positive, and thetube was considered kinked. If the tube did not spontaneously spin back andstayed in position upon release, the test was considered negative. Regardless ofthe results of this test, the tube was secured, and a postprocedure chestradiograph was obtained. The criterion standard for determining a kinked chesttube was its appearance on this chest radiograph. RESULTS: A total of 103 chesttubes were placed by using the Mac-technique test. The test was positive in eightplacements; four tubes were kinked on chest radiograph. The Mac-technique testwas negative in 95 placements; four tubes were kinked on chest radiograph. TheMac technique had a sensitivity of 50% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 15.7% to84.3%), a specificity of 95.8% (95% CI = 89.6% to 98.8%), a positive likelihoodratio of 11.9, a negative likelihood ratio of 0.52, and an odds ratio using Yatescorrection of 20.3 (95% CI = 4.1 to 102.1). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of thisstudy, a positive Mac-technique test is useful to detect chest tubes that arelikely to be kinked after insertion and before securing.",16365333,16365333

The impact ofpositive-outcome bias, time-lag bias, and gray literature bias also was assessed.METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of RCT abstracts presented at nine SAEMscientific meetings. Electronic searches identified publications from theabstracts. RESULTS: Of 4,399 abstracts, 383 (8.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] =7.8% to 9.5%) were identified as RCTs. One hundred ninety-four (50.7%; 95% CI =45.7% to 55.7%) were subsequently published up to May 2004. The median time topublication was 32 months (95% CI = 23 to 41), with 59% of RCT abstractspublished within five years of presentation. No evidence of positive-outcome biasor time-lag bias was identified; however, changes from abstract to manuscriptwere found. Manuscripts were less likely to endorse the experimental interventionthan were abstracts (OR, 0.2; 95% CI = 0.0 to 0.6). CONCLUSIONS: The proportionof emergency medicine RCT abstracts published is slightly lower than that forother biomedical specialties; however, biases reported by investigators in otherbiomedical areas do not appear to be as problematic in emergency medicineresearch. Differences between conclusions from abstracts and manuscripts must beconsidered when employing meeting abstracts as a source of evidence for futureresearch or for systematic reviews in emergency medicine.",16365332,16365332
7084787977243506621,16365331,Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic,Lerner EB,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the accuracy of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) caseascertainment using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision,Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes proposed by the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention (CDC) in a 2003 Report to Congress. METHODS: This was aprospective cohort study of all patients presenting to an urban academicemergency department (ED) over six months in 2003. A real-time clinicalassessment of mild TBI was compared with the ICD-9 codes assigned after ED orhospital discharge for a determination of sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS:Of the 35,096 patients presenting to the ED, 516 had clinically defined mild TBIand 1,000 were assigned one or more of the mild TBI ICD-9 codes proposed by theCDC. The sensitivity of these codes was 45.9% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] =41.3% to 50.2%) with a specificity of 97.8% (95% CI = 97.6% to 97.9%).CONCLUSIONS: The identification of mild TBI patients using retrospectivelyassigned ICD-9 codes appears to be inaccurate. These codes are associated with asignificant number of false-positive and false-negative code assignments. MildTBI incidence and prevalence estimates using these codes should be interpretedwith caution. ICD-9 codes should not replace a clinical assessment for mild TBIwhen accurate case ascertainment is required.",16365331,16365331
7084787977243506621,16365330,Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic,Hoerauf K,"OBJECTIVES: In this study, the authors tested whether electromagneticinterference (EMI) is able to impair correct electrocardiogram analysis andproduce false-positive shock advice from automated external defibrillators (AEDs)when the true rhythm is sinus. METHODS: Nineteen healthy subjects were used totest five AEDs available on the Austrian market in a prospective, open, andsequence-randomized study. The primary outcome variable was the absolute numberof shocks advised in the presence of EMI. The secondary outcome was the number ofimpaired analyses caused by incorrectly detected patient movements or electrodefailure. RESULTS: Of 760 tests run, 18 (2.37%) cases of false-positive resultsoccurred, and two of five AEDs recommended shocks in the presence of sinusrhythm. Of 760 tests run, no electrode failures occurred. There were 27occurrences (3.55%) of motion detected by an AED in the presence of strongelectromagnetic fields. CONCLUSIONS: AED models differ in their response to EMI;it may be useful to consider specific safety requirements for areas with suchfields present. Working personnel and emergency medical services staff should beinformed about potential risks and the possible need for patient evacuationbefore AEDs are attached and shock recommendations are followed.",16365330,16365330
7084787977243506621,16365329,Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic,Green RA,"OBJECTIVES: Significant variation in emergency department (ED) patient arrivalrates necessitates the adjustment of staffing patterns to optimize the timelycare of patients. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a queueing model inidentifying provider staffing patterns to reduce the fraction of patients wholeave without being seen. METHODS: The authors collected detailed ED arrival datafrom an urban hospital and used a Lag SIPP queueing analysis to gain insights onhow to change provider staffing to decrease the proportion of patients who leavewithout being seen. The authors then compared this proportion for the same39-week period before and after the resulting changes. RESULTS: Despite anincrease in arrival volume of 1,078 patients (6.3%), an average increase inprovider hours of 12 hours per week (3.1%) resulted in 258 fewer patients wholeft without being seen. This represents a decrease in the proportion of patientswho left without being seen by 22.9%. Restricting attention to a four-day subsetof the week during which there was no increase in total provider hours, areallocation of providers based on the queueing model resulted in 161 fewerpatients who left without being seen (21.7%), despite an additional 548 patients(5.5%) arriving in the second half of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Timely access to aprovider is a critical dimension of ED quality performance. In an environment inwhich EDs are often understaffed, analyses of arrival patterns and the use ofqueueing models can be extremely useful in identifying the most effectiveallocation of staff.",16365329,16365329
7084787977243506621,16365328,Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic,Cohen DM,"BACKGROUND: Cefdinir, an extended-spectrum cephalosporin administered orally, isapproved by the U.S. Federal Drug Administration for treatment of skin andrespiratory tract infections. During the last two years at the authors'institution, this agent has been used as an off-label treatment for urinary tractinfections in children. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate antimicrobial susceptibilitytesting data in children to determine whether there is support for thisprescribing practice. METHODS: In this retrospective study (2003-2004), theauthors compared the susceptibility patterns of urinary pathogens to cefdinir andselected antibiotics in children who were evaluated for urinary tract infectionsin an urban tertiary academic pediatric emergency department. Pathogens(community acquired vs. opportunistic or nosocomial) were categorized assusceptible, indeterminate, or resistant on the basis of antibioticsusceptibility breakpoints. The frequency of these categorizations for individualdrugs was determined. RESULTS: Seven hundred five isolates were recovered fromurine during the study period. Pathogens isolated most frequently wereEscherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, and Proteus spp. Of 431 isolates retained inthe data set, 412 (95.6%) were susceptible to cefdinir. This rate was comparableor superior to rates observed for other antibiotics: 49.4% for ampicillin, 84.9%for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 88.4% for cefazolin, 93.3% for nitrofurantoin,94.2% for ticarcillin-clavulanate potassium, 97.5% for gentamicin, and 97.7% forceftriaxone. Cefdinir, however, had lower activity (64.7%) against 17 bacterialisolates categorized as opportunistic or nosocomial pathogens. CONCLUSIONS:Cefdinir provides good coverage against common pathogens responsible for urinarytract infections in children and compares favorably with other oral andparenteral antibiotics that are used in the empiric treatment of this infection.",16365328,16365328
7084787977243506621,16365327,Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic,Camargo CA Jr,"OBJECTIVES: Little is known about whether emergency department (ED) patients orthose who accompany them (visitors) are interested in smoking cessation. Theauthors hypothesized that several variables would be associated with stage ofchange, including nicotine dependence, self-efficacy, presence of asmoking-related illness, and anticipated cessation-related health improvement.METHODS: For two 24-hour periods, consecutive patients and visitors aged 18 yearsand older presenting to four Boston EDs were interviewed. The authors assessed arange of smoking-related constructs. Exclusion criteria included severe illness,cognitive insufficiency, and acute distress. RESULTS: One thousand ten subjectswere screened (56% patients, 44% visitors). Two hundred thirty-seven (23%)subjects were current smokers, with 57% being in precontemplation, 31% incontemplation, and 12% in preparation stages. When ordinal regression was used,the variables most strongly associated with stage of change were as follows:self-efficacy (odds ratio [OR] = 5.1; p < 0.001), anticipated cessation-relatedhealth improvement (OR = 2.7; p = 0.02), and having a smoking-related healthproblem (OR = 1.9; p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Because many disenfranchised Americansuse the ED as a regular source of health care, increased attention to smoking inthe ED setting holds tremendous public health potential. This study's resultsreinforce the validity of the stage-of-change model within the ED setting.Developers of ED-initiated interventions will have to consider the heterogeneityin stage of change when designing their treatments.",16365327,16365327
7084787977243506621,16365326,Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic,Newgard CD,"OBJECTIVES: To validate the accuracy of using probabilistic linkage for matchingde-identified ambulance records to a state trauma registry. METHODS: This was aretrospective cohort analysis. Three thousand nine hundred nineteen true matchesbetween ambulance and state trauma registry data from 1998 to 2003 wereidentified by deterministic matching on trauma identification number and verifiedby human review. Two thousand thirty-eight ambulance records from trauma patientsnot meeting criteria for a true match, and an identical number of trauma registryrecords randomly selected from the one local county served by a different EMSprovider, were included as nonmatches. There were 17 variables considered forlinkage, which included the following: age, gender, race, county, hospital, date,rural setting, call and arrival times, mechanism, penetrating injury, vitalsigns, intubation, and intoxication. Probabilistic linkage was used to link thetwo data sets, using seven different combinations of common variables (maximum,17; minimum, 4). The sensitivity and specificity of identifying true matches andnonmatches (95% confidence intervals [95% CI]) were calculated for eachcombination of variables. RESULTS: Using all 17 available variables, 3,766 of3,919 true matches were appropriately linked (sensitivity, 96.1%; 95% CI = 95.4%to 96.7%), with eight mismatches (specificity, 99.6%; 95% CI = 99.2% to 99.8%).Sensitivity fell below 95% with < 15 variables; however, sensitivity was verydependent on the inclusion of variables with high discriminatory power.Specificity remained >98% regardless of the number of variables included.CONCLUSIONS: Probabilistic linkage is a valid method for matching ambulancerecords to a trauma registry without the use of patient identifiers; however, thesensitivity of identifying true matches is critically dependent on the number andtype of common variables included in the analysis.",16365326,16365326
7084787977243506621,16365325,Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic,Pines JM,"Confirmation bias is a pitfall in emergency care and may lead to inaccuratediagnoses and inappropriate treatments and care plans. Because of the increasingseverity and volume of emergency care, emergency physicians often must rely onheuristics, such as rule-out protocols, as a guide to diagnosing and treatingpatients. The use of heuristics or protocols can be potentially misleading if theinitial diagnostic impression is incorrect. To minimize cognitive dissonance,clinicians may accentuate confirmatory data and ignore nonconfirmatory data.Clinicians should recognize confirmation bias as a potential pitfall in medicaldecision making in the emergency department. Reliance on the scientific method,Bayesian reasoning, metacognition, and cognitive forcing strategies may serve toimprove diagnostic accuracy and improve patient care.",16365325,16365325

During July2003, emergency medical services (EMS) providers were asked to call an EMSdestination-control physician for patients requesting transport to eitherhospital. The destination-control physician determined the optimal patientdestination by using patient and system variables as well as EMS providers' andpatients' input. Program process measures were evaluated to characterize theprogram. Administrative data were reviewed to compare system characteristicsbetween the intervention program month and a control month. RESULTS: During theintervention month, 2,708 patients were transported to the participatinghospitals. EMS providers contacted the destination-control physician for 1,866(69%) patients. The original destination was changed for 253 (14%) patients.Reasons for redirecting patients included system needs, patient needs, physicianaffiliation, recent ED or hospital care, patient wishes, and primary carephysician wishes. During the intervention month, EMS diversion decreased 190(41%) hours at the university hospital and 62 (61%) hours at the communityhospital, as compared with the control month. CONCLUSIONS: A voluntary,physician-directed destination-control program that directs EMS units to the EDmost able to provide appropriate and timely care is feasible. Patients wereredirected to maximize continuity of care and optimally use available emergencyhealth care resources. This type of program may be effective in reducingovercrowding.",16365324,16365324
7084787977243506621,16365323,Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic,Vaage J,"OBJECTIVES: Aminosteroids of the lazaroid type protect organs fromischemia-reperfusion damage. The authors hypothesized that lazaroid U-83836E maybe beneficial in a shock model with hemorrhage combined with limb ischemia.Furthermore, the authors hypothesized that lazaroids induce expression of heatshock proteins (HSPs) of the 72-kDa family. METHODS: Rats were divided into twogroups (lazaroid and control groups, n = 8 each) and pretreated with the lazaroidU-83836E (5 mg/kg) or with vehicle intraperitoneally at 12 and 24 hours beforeexperiments. At the time of the experiment, rats were anesthetized, and thefemoral artery of each rat was cannulated. After 20 minutes of stabilization,blood was shed from each rat to bring its mean arterial pressure to 24-28 mmHgfor 2 hours. Bilateral tourniquets were tightened proximally on the rat thighsduring those 2 hours and then released. Shed blood plus equal amounts of Ringeracetate then were infused to restore normal blood pressure, followed by acontinuous infusion of Ringer acetate, the rate of which was regulated tomaintain blood pressure, until 30 minutes after start of resuscitation. Fluidresuscitation was stopped, and rats were observed for another 3.5 hours. At theend of the observation period, the rats' hearts were collected for immunoblotanalysis of HSP72. Additional hearts were collected from similarly pretreatedrats not undergoing the episode of hemorrhagic shock and fluid resuscitation.RESULTS: Pretreatment with U-83836E improved mean arterial blood pressure afterhemorrhagic shock and fluid resuscitation (p = 0.02), combined with improvementsin acid-base balance (improved base excess and standard bicarbonate; p = 0.02 andp = 0.01, respectively). Western blot of cardiac protein extracts demonstratedthat lazaroid pretreatment increased expression of HSP72. CONCLUSIONS:Pretreatment with the lazaroid U-83836E improved outcome markers in thishemorrhagic shock model. The observed protection may be caused by increasedexpression of HSP72.",16365323,16365323

The purpose of this randomized,double-blind, sham control study was to determine whether auricular acupressurecan decrease not only the level of anxiety but also the level of pain in a groupof elder patients with acute hip fracture. METHODS: With the assistance of theVienna Red Cross, 38 patients with acute hip fracture were enrolled into thisstudy. Patients were randomized into two study groups: the true interventiongroup and the sham control group. Subjects in the true intervention group (n =18) received bilateral auricular acupressure at three auricular acupressurepoints for hip pain. Patients in the sham group (n = 20) received bilateralauricular acupressure at sham points. Baseline demographic information, anxietylevel, pain level, blood pressure, and heart rate were obtained before theadministration of the appropriate acupressure intervention. The level of anxiety,level of pain, hemodynamic profiles, and level of satisfaction were reassessedonce the patients arrived at the hospital. RESULTS: Patients in the trueintervention groups had less pain (F = 28, p = 0.0001) and anxiety (F = 4.3, p =0.018) and lower heart rate (F = 18, p = 0.0001) on arrival at the hospital thandid patients in the sham control group. As a result, the patients in the trueintervention group reported higher satisfaction in the care they received duringthe ride to the hospital.

Prompt and accurate risk stratification to identify thosepatients with NSTE chest pain who are at highest risk for adverse events isessential, however, to optimal management. Although validated and used frequentlyin patients already enrolled in acute coronary syndrome trials, the Thrombolysisin Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score never has been examined for its valuein risk stratification in an all-comers, non-trial-based ED chest painpopulation. METHODS: An analysis of an ED-based prospective observational cohortstudy was conducted in 3,929 adult patients presenting with chest pain syndromeand warranting evaluation with an electrocardiogram. These patients had TIMI riskscores determined at ED presentation. The main outcome was the composite ofdeath, acute myocardial infarction (MI), and revascularization within 30 days.RESULTS: The TIMI risk score at ED presentation successfully risk-stratified thisunselected cohort of chest pain patients with respect to 30-day adverse outcome,with a range from 2.1%, with a score of 0, to 100%, with a score of 7. Thehighest correlation of an individual TIMI risk indicator to adverse outcome wasfor elevated cardiac biomarker at admission. Overall, the score had similarperformance characteristics to that seen when applied to other databases ofpatients enrolled in clinical trials and registries using a 14-day end point.CONCLUSIONS: The TIMI risk score may be a useful tool for risk stratification ofED patients with chest pain syndrome.",16365321,16365321

METHOD: Students completed a knowledge, skills,and attitudes questionnaire before the curriculum, after the final learningexperience, and one year later. A 95% confidence interval (CI) for paireddifferences assessed change over time. At one year, students also responded toitems about their use of the curriculum, error reporting, and disclosureexperiences. RESULTS: Fifty three of 92 students (55%) completed thequestionnaire at all three assessment points. Students' eight items and thecalculated knowledge score improved after the curriculum but only seven of theseimprovements were sustained one year. Responses to seven items did not change andfive changed in an undesired direction after the curriculum and/or after oneyear. Seventy two students completed the self-reported behavior questions at oneyear. More than half reported using what they learned in the curriculum. Although76% of students reported observing an error, 71% of these disclosed an error totheir peers, 56% to a resident, and 46% to faculty. Only 7% reported an errorusing our electronic error reporting system. CONCLUSIONS: The curriculum led tochanges in second-year medical students' knowledge, skills, and attitudes, butnot all of the changes were sustained at one year, were in the desired direction,or were supported by their self-reported behaviors. The extent to which otherinformal or hidden curriculum experiences reversed the gains and affected thechanges at one year is unknown.",16377828,16377828

METHOD: Twenty-six resident physicianswere randomly selected from a single teaching hospital and participated inin-depth qualitative interviews. Transcripts were analyzed iteratively and themesidentified. RESULTS: Residents expressed intense emotional responses to errorevents. Poor patient outcomes and greater perceived personal responsibility wereassociated with more intense reactions and greater personal anguish. For thegreat majority of residents, their ability to cope with these events wasdependent on a combination of reassurance and opportunities for learning.Interactions with medical colleagues and supervisory physicians were critical tothis coping process. CONCLUSIONS: Medical mishaps have a profound impact onresident physicians by eliciting intense emotional responses. It is critical thatresident training programs recognize the personal and professional significanceof these experiences for young physicians. Moreover, resident education mustsupport the development of constructive coping skills by facilitating candiddiscussion and learning subsequent to these events.",16377827,16377827

METHOD: In2002-03, 47 interns in the internal medicine resident program at the Universityof Pennsylvania School of Medicine completed the following instruments atbaseline and at year end: sleep quantities, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the BeckDepression Inventory-Short Form, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, and theMaslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey. The prevalences of acute andchronic sleep deprivation, subjective sleepiness, burnout, empathy, anddepression at the beginning of the year were compared to prevalences at the endof internship. Associations between sleep deprivation and mood, empathy, orburnout were explored. RESULTS: The prevalence of chronic sleep deprivation,depression, burnout, and empathy increased from baseline to year end.Specifically, the prevalence of ""high"" scores changed for chronic sleepdeprivation (9% to 43%, p = .0001). The prevalence of moderate depressionincreased from 4.3% to 29.8% (p = .0002). Only 4.3% reported a high level ofburnout initially compared with 55.3% at year end (p < .0001). Scores that wereoriginally more favorable than general population norms (p < .001) approachednorms at the end of the year for empathic concern (p = .15). There was anassociation between becoming chronically sleep deprived and becoming depressed(OR = 7, p = .014). CONCLUSIONS: Given the association between chronic sleepdeprivation and mood disturbances during internship, outcome assessment iswarranted to see if duty-hour reform will translate into more hours slept orfewer hours worked, coincident with improved mood.",16377826,16377826

METHOD:In 2003, the authors surveyed 164 internal medicine residents at three clinicaltraining sites affiliated with the University of California, San Francisco, aftersystem changes were introduced to reduce duty hours. On a questionnaire that usedvarious rating scales, residents reported the value of educational activities,frequency of administrative tasks interfering with education, and educationalsatisfaction after duty hours were reduced. The authors compared univariatestatistics and developed multivariable models to discern the relationship betweenhours worked and educational outcomes. RESULTS: In all, 125 residents (76%)responded. Residents rated the educational activities, morning report, andteaching others most highly. Answering pages and tasks related to scheduling werethe most frequent barriers to educational activities. Residents reported thattime spent in administrative activities did not change after duty-hourrestrictions, and 68% said that decreased duty hours had no impact or a negativeimpact on education. In multivariable models, postgraduate year (PGY)-1 residents(p = .004), residents who reported feeling overwhelmed at work (p < .0001), andresidents who reported working more than 80 hours per week (p < .05) had lowerwork satisfaction. However, only PGY-1 residents (p < .05) and those who feltoverwhelmed with work (p = .01) were less satisfied with their education.CONCLUSIONS: In this residency program, duty-hour reduction did not improveeducational satisfaction. Educational satisfaction may be more a function ofworkload than hours worked; therefore, systematic changes to residents' work-lifemay be necessary to improve educational satisfaction.",16377825,16377825

METHOD: The new system was implemented in the internal medicineresidency program at the University Hospital at the University of CincinnatiMedical Center. In 2003-04, residents and faculty were surveyed about theirexperiences with the new and old ward systems relative to duty-hour requirements,patient care, and resident education. Responses were given on a five-point scale(5 = strongly agree, 1 = strongly disagree). Data were compiled and comparedusing a two-sample t-test. RESULTS: Faculty believed the new system improvedcompliance with the duty-hour requirements (mean = 4.3, 95% confidence interval[CI]: 4.1-4.6), although were neutral regarding patient care (mean = 3.5, 95% CI:3.2-3.8) and education (mean = 3.3, 95% CI: 2.9-3.6). Residents were more neutralregarding ACGME requirements (mean = 3.5, 95% CI: 3.3-3.7) and patient care (mean= 3.2, 95% CI 3.0-3.3). Residents reported a slightly negative impact oneducation (mean = 2.8, 95% CI: 2.5-3.0). In response to an exclusive question,residents reported that the new system did not reduce fatigue (mean = 2.7, 95%CI: 2.6-3.0). CONCLUSIONS: Respondents perceived that this ward call system metACGME requirements and maintained quality patient care but may have sacrificedsome traditional resident education tenets.",16377824,16377824

METHOD: Four focusgroups of internal medicine residents at Barnes-Jewish Hospital at the WashingtonUniversity School of Medicine were conducted during February and March 2004.Twenty-six housestaff from the first three years of residency participated; allwere volunteers. Transcripts were analyzed for major themes. RESULTS: Bothresidents and interns supported work hour limitations and enjoyed the benefits ofworking fewer hours. However, they had difficulty complying with therestrictions, particularly if they felt patient care, teaching, or their owneducation would be compromised. Participants perceived that restricted work hoursdiminished the continuity of patient care and increased the likelihood of medicalerrors such as those resulting from delayed follow-up of diagnostic tests. Bothinterns and residents found it difficult to attend conferences, and residentsfound fewer opportunities to teach. Effects on job satisfaction were mixed as aresult of work hour restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: Residents in the sample favoredwork hour restrictions but had serious concerns about the effects of therestrictions on patient care and medical education. The findings suggest thatimposing rigid work hour restrictions has significant consequences for patientcare and medical education and that the most effective ways to balance work hourlimitations with the demands of patient care and necessary educational componentsto train competent physicians have yet to be identified.",16377823,16377823

METHOD: Evaluations of fourclerkships were compared for two student cohorts at the University of MichiganMedical School. The first cohort, from the class of 2002-03, completed theirclinical clerkships the year before the work-hour restrictions were implemented,and the second cohort, from the class of 2003-04, completed their clerkships thesame year the restrictions were implemented. RESULTS: There were significant andnotable differences in the experiences of the two cohorts. Students' perceptionsof the quality of their experiences in the surgery-oriented clerkships(obstetrics-gynecology and surgery) in particular were significantly lower (i.e.,more negative) in the 2003-04 cohort than in the previous cohort for the sameclerkships. The nonsurgery-oriented clerkships (internal medicine and pediatrics)hired hospitalists, who offset the residents' workload (internal medicine) andassumed teaching responsibilities (pediatrics). Between 2002-03 and 2003-04,students' perceptions of the quality of their experience in the internal medicineclerkship remained mostly stable, and increased in several areas for the studentsin the pediatrics clerkship. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of resident work-hourrestrictions had significant effects on the education of the medical studentsstudied. These effects need to be carefully analyzed and considered to ensurequality education for medical students. The findings also highlight that thenature of students' perceptions was related to preparations made (or not) byspecific clerkships as restricted work-hour regulations were adopted.",16377822,16377822

Results includemeans, percentages, and t-tests on mean differences. Of the 146 faculty members(63%) who completed the questionnaire, 101 volunteered to be interviewed. Ofthese, 28 were randomly chosen for follow-up interviews that probed experiencesand rationales underlying items on the questionnaire. Interview transcripts (187single-spaced pages) were analyzed for main themes. RESULTS: Questionnairerespondents and interviewees associated duty-hour restrictions with loweredfaculty expectations and standards for residents, little change in thesupervision of residents, a loss of time for teaching, increased work and stress,and less satisfaction. No significant differences in these perceptions (p < or =.05) were found for faculty in academic and nonacademic programs. Main themesfrom the interviews included a shift of routine work from residents to faculty, atransfer of responsibility to faculty, more frequent skill gaps at night, a lossof time for research, and the challenges of controlling residents' hours.CONCLUSIONS: Duty-hour restrictions have been consequential for the work ofsurgical faculty. Faculty should not be overlooked in future studies of duty-hourrestrictions.",16377820,16377820

New practices havedeveloped but standards (best practices) are still evolving. Based on theauthors' review and analysis of a number of sources, they present a set ofsystematically compiled best practices for research record-keeping for academicresearch groups. These best practices were developed as an adjunct to a researchproject on research ethics aimed at examining the actual research record-keepingpractices of active academic scientists and their impact on research misconductinquiries. The best practices differentiate and provide separate standards forthree different levels within the university: the individual researcher, theresearch group leader, and the department/institution.

However, the value of performanceimprovement programs in an AMC is often challenging. At Jefferson MedicalCollege, clinical efficiency and bed availability are important priorities to theDepartment of Medicine. To this end, a multidisciplinary program was designed to(1) improve the quality and consistency of care by adapting and adopting nationalguidelines for patients with heart failure and acute coronary syndrome; (2)identify and improve hospital operational supports and maximize resourceutilization; (3) increase hospital functional capacity to make way for increasedvolume; and (4) improve housestaff education and practice by using evidence-basedapproaches and by optimizing teaching relationships between housestaff andattending faculty. The eight-month project (November 2002 to July 2003) resultedin improvement in several quality measures including increased use of betablockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for heart failure patients,reduced length of stay for heart failure and acute coronary syndrome patients,and increased satisfaction of the clinicians involved in caring for thesepatients.

The authors examined whether work-relatedstressors in academic medicine negatively affected the physical and mentalhealth, as well as life and job satisfaction, of academic medical school faculty.METHOD: A 136-item self-administered anonymous questionnaire modified from asmall 1984 study was distributed to 3,519 academic faculty at four U.S. medicalschools following institutional review board approval at each school. Validatedscales measuring depression, anxiety, work strain, and job and life satisfaction;a checklist of common physical and mental health symptoms; and questions aboutthe impact of institutional financial stability, colleague attrition, and otherwork-related perceptions were used. Responses were analyzed by sex, academicrank, age, marital status, faculty discipline, and medical school. RESULTS:Responses were received from 1,951 full-time academic physicians and basicscience faculty, a 54.3% response rate. Twenty percent of faculty, almost equalby sex, had significant levels of depressive symptoms, with higher levels inyounger faculty. Perception of financial instability was associated with greaterlevels of work strain, depression, and anxiety. Significant numbers of facultyacknowledged that work-related strain negatively affected their mental health andjob satisfaction, but not life satisfaction or physical health. Specialties weredifferentially affected. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of depression, anxiety, and jobdissatisfaction-especially in younger faculty-raise concerns about the well-beingof academic faculty and its impact on trainees and patient care.

METHOD: In 2003-04,semistructured interviews of 18 deans at U.S. colleges of medicine or AMCs wereorganized around four dimensions: background, leadership challenges,organizational effectiveness, and systems enablers/restrainers for leadership. Avalues Q-sort was used to determine how widely core values were shared amongdeans and how the complex challenges they faced did or did not align with thesevalues. RESULTS: Fourteen of the 18 (78%) deans identified financial difficultiesas their most pressing leadership challenge, followed by weak institutionalalignment (61%), staffing problems (33%), and poor morale (28%). Open, candidcommunication was reported as the most effective means of addressing thesecomplex problems. Enacting espoused shared values and having a positive attitudewere identified as the most important enablers of systemic leadership, whereasmicromanagement and difficult people were the major restraints. Q-sort results on38 positive leadership values indicated that participants considered integritymost essential. Integrity was positively correlated with humanistic values andnegatively correlated with results. Vision, another highly espoused value,correlated strongly with performance-oriented values but correlated negativelywith humanistic values. CONCLUSIONS: A dynamic tension exists in AMCs betweenhumanistic values and performance-based core values. The ability to manage thattension (i.e., when to prioritize one set of values over the other) is inherentin a dean's work.",16377814,16377814

Little is knownabout the effect of new accreditation requirements on GME practice and outcomes.The authors conducted a cross-sectional survey designed to provide descriptivedata about DIOs and to validate a DIO Responsibility Scale (DIORS). METHOD: DIOswere identified by the ACGME. The following delivery strategy was used toadminister the survey from January 2004 to May 2004: prenotice letter; surveywith self-addressed, stamped return envelope and cover letter; thank-you/reminderpostcard; and replacement survey with new cover letter and self-addressed,stamped return envelope. RESULTS: Completed surveys were received from 243 of 363DIOs (66.9%). Responses indicated wide ranges in DIO titles, report titles, timespent accomplishing responsibilities, DIO-specific salaries, credentials, andGraduate Medical Education Committee reporting arrangements. DIOs reportedconfusion or overlap between DIO and program director roles (72.0%), decreasingfunding for GME (50.6%), and inadequate support staff (25.1%). The 11-item DIOResponsibility Scale demonstrated a Cronbach alpha of .86 and a statisticallysignificant relationship to five variables selected to establish constructvalidity. CONCLUSIONS: The wide variability in DIO characteristics found in thisstudy supports the premise that the DIO role is underdeveloped. The authorsestablished the reliability and validity of the DIORS, which now may be used infuture research of the DIO role. The data from this study may be used by DIOs andinstitutions to develop the role further, improve DIO performance, and createmore useful job descriptions.",16377812,16377812

METHODS AND MATERIALS:An electronic survey was sent to 291 members of the Association of ProgramDirectors in Radiology. Responses were compared directly with an earlier surveyof senior residents who participated in the same cycle of the Fellowship Match.RESULTS: Sixty-seven respondents participated in the survey. Based on ourestimates of the total number of US-based radiology subspecialty fellowshipprograms, this represents between 15.3% (67/438) and 24.2% (67/277) of allfellowship directors. Approximately three quarters (52/76 directors; 77.6%)participated in the Fellowship Match. Respondents believe that the match processmakes the process fairer for all applicants (31/43 respondents; 70.5%) andprimarily benefits residents (30/76 respondents; 60.0%), a significant differencecompared with senior residents (P < .01).

7084787977243506621,16399039,Academic radiology,Hoffman EA,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: A computational modeling framework of soft-tissuemechanics and air flow has been developed toward the aim of linking computedtomography measures of ventilation distribution to subject-specific predictionsin imaging-based geometric models of the lung. The aim of this approach is toenable predictions of the effect of perturbations in geometry or functionalparameters on imaged function of the lung. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computationaltechniques that can deal with anatomic detail and spatially distributed nonlinearmaterial properties are used to model parenchymal soft-tissue mechanics in aphysically realistic model of the ovine lung. The lung is modeled as ahomogeneous, compressible, nonlinearly elastic body. Using equations for largedeformation mechanics, change in geometry of the lung is simulated at staticinflation pressures from 25 cm H2O to 0 cm H2O. Multidetector row computedtomography imaging defines the model geometry, the movement of the model lungsurface during inflation, and displacement of airway bifurcations for comparisonwith predicted internal displacements of the model. RESULTS: A novel modelingframework has been formulated that links equations for large deformation of thelung tissue to equations for airway flow and pressure. This preliminary modelpredicts airway displacements that are in good agreement with imageddisplacements (total root mean square [RMS] error < 4 mm from 25 to 0 cm H2O).CONCLUSIONS: State-of-the-art computed tomography imaging is interpreted using amodeling framework to predict ventilation distribution and changes in thegeometry of the lung during increments in inflation pressure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tenradiologists independently interpreted 104 mammograms containing clusteredmicrocalcifications. Forty-six of these were malignant and 58 were benign atbiopsy. Radiologists read the images with and without a computer aid by using acounterbalanced study design. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated fromobserver biopsy recommendations, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC)curves were computed from their diagnostic confidence ratings. Unaideddouble-reading sensitivity and specificity values were derived post hoc by usingthree different objective rules and an additional rule of simulated-optimaldouble reading that assumed that consultations for resolving two radiologists'different independent diagnoses always produce the correct clinicalrecommendation. ROC curves of unaided double readings were obtained according tothe literature. RESULTS: Single reading without computer aid yielded 74%sensitivity and 32% specificity, whereas CAD reading yielded 87% sensitivity and42% specificity and appeared on a higher ROC curve (P < .0001). Three methods offormulating independent double readings generated sensitivities between 59% and89%, specificities between 50% and 13%, and operating points that movedessentially along the average unaided single-reading ROC curve. ROC curves ofunaided independent double readings showed small, statistically insignificantimprovement over those of unaided single readings.

7084787977243506621,16399035,Academic radiology,Kurmis TP,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Stratifying candidates objectively on the merit ofpublication portfolios is an onerous and difficult task. Institutional committeesare under increasing pressure to rank applicants based on previous achievementsfor appointments/promotions, funding, and awards, and must do so withinunforgiving time constraints. The journal impact factor (IF) has been looselyadopted in many circles for assessing article ""quality,"" circumventing detailedreview of individual articles. The premise supporting such practice often hingeson assuming that high-IF journals are harder to publish in, for example, havehigher rejection rates (RRs), and therefore, authors achieving publication insuch periodicals should be ""recognized"" for their achievement. There is noevidence of previous research linking IF and RR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A subsetof Institute for Scientific Information (ISI)-listed radiology journals, forwhich IF data were available, was identified and a direct-contact survey approach(63.3% response rate) used to ascertain journal manuscript RR. RESULTS: Of thesample reviewed, the ISI-listed IF values ranged from 4.759 to 0.056 (mean1.491), and editor-reported manuscript RRs from 80.0% to 8.0% (mean 47.8%).Statistical comparison of IF and RR using linear regression yielded an r2 valueof 0.223. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this study demonstrates poor linear agreementbetween IF and RR for manuscripts submitted to peer-reviewed radiology journals.This suggests that journal IF is a poor predictor of RR, and vice versa. Thisfinding may be of interest to institutional committees who have adopted the IF asan indicator of merit in reviewing publication curriculum vitae, and mayencourage rethinking of currently practiced candidate assessment approaches.",16399035,16399035

We examined if it were possible todifferentiate the subcortical white matter of the HG from the superior temporalgyrus (STG) using diffusion tensor (DT) imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The studywas approved and informed consent was obtained in accordance with the guidelinesof our Institutional Review Board for human subject studies. We examined sixhealthy adult volunteers with DT images using 20 orientations and repeated 11times. The fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient(ADC) were calculated. RESULTS: The mean FA of the subcortical white matter ofthe HG (0.37) was higher than that of the STG (0.27) on both sides (P < .01).There was no statistically significant difference when comparing left and rightHG and STG (P > .05). There was no statistically significant difference in meanADC of the HGs and STGs (0.75 x 10(-3) mm(2)/sec, P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: The FAin the subcortical white matter of the HG was higher than that of the STG in bothhemispheres. These changes in DT imaging may be accounted for by the presence ofthe auditory radiations.",16399034,16399034
7084787977243506621,16399033,Academic radiology,Bick U,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Accurate quantification of the shape and extent ofbreast tumors has a vital role in nearly all applications of breast magneticresonance (MR) imaging (MRI). Specifically, tumor segmentation is a key componentin the computerized assessment of likelihood of malignancy. However, manualdelineation of lesions in four-dimensional MR images is labor intensive andsubject to interobserver and intraobserver variations. We developed acomputerized lesion segmentation method that has the advantage of beingautomatic, efficient, and objective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present a fuzzyc-means (FCM) clustering-based method for the segmentation of breast lesions inthree dimensions from contrast-enhanced MR images. The proposed lesionsegmentation algorithm consists of six consecutive stages: region of interest(ROI) selection by a human operator, lesion enhancement within the selected ROI,application of FCM on the enhanced ROI, binarization of the lesion membershipmap, connected-component labeling and object selection, and hole-filling on theselected object. We applied the algorithm to a clinical MR database consisting of121 primary mass lesions. Manual segmentation of the lesions by an expert MRradiologist served as a reference in the evaluation of the computerizedsegmentation method. We also compared the proposed algorithm with a previouslydeveloped volume-growing (VG) method. RESULTS: For the 121 mass lesions in ourdatabase, 97% of lesions were segmented correctly by means of the proposedFCM-based method at an overlap threshold of 0.4, whereas 84% of lesions werecorrectly segmented by means of the VG method. CONCLUSION: Our proposed algorithmfor breast-lesion segmentation in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was shown to beeffective and efficient.",16399033,16399033
7084787977243506621,16399032,Academic radiology,Wang G,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Temporal studies (such as blood perfusion) commonly areused to measure function. Radiation dosage is a primary limiting factor for thesescans. Half-scan reconstruction can decrease dosage and improve temporalresolution, but is not viable for quantitative studies because of shadingartifact. We propose a method for identifying the artifact and minimizing itseffect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: It is possible to measure the shading artifact byproducing both a full-scan and a half-scan reconstruction from the sameprojection data. A correlation was shown between the subset of data used forreconstruction and per-pixel variation. Furthermore, this variation can beparameterized by only the center angle of the projection data. By performing asingle full-scan acquisition, it is possible to generate many half-scanreconstructions and measure the artifact; then future half-scan acquisitions canbe corrected. RESULTS: The artifact is caused by the inhomogeneity in the objectbeing scanned. Before correction, the root mean square error between thehalf-scan reconstruction and the full-scan is 41.0. After correction, the erroris decreased to 10.7, or 26% of the original value. CONCLUSION: We present amethod that can measure and correct for object-dependent half-scan shadingartifact. This can enable half-scan reconstruction for use in quantitativetemporal studies.",16399032,16399032

Moreover, majorstereotactic brain atlases are based on the AC and PC. Our goal is to provide analgorithm for a rapid, robust, accurate and automatic identification of AC andPC. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The method exploits anatomical and radiologicalproperties of AC, PC and surrounding structures, including morphologicalvariability. The localization is done in two stages: coarse and fine. The coarsestage locates the AC and PC on the midsagittal plane by analyzing theirrelationships with the corpus callosum, fornix, and brainstem. The fine stagerefines the AC and PC in a well-defined volume of interest, analyzing locationsof lateral and third ventricles, interhemispheric fissure, and massa intermedia.RESULTS: The algorithm was developed using simple operations, like histogramming,thresholding, region growing, 1D projections. It was tested on 94 diversified T1Wand SPGR datasets. After the fine stage, 71 (76%) volumes had an error between0-1 mm for the AC and 55 (59%) for the PC. The mean errors were 1.0 mm (AC) and1.0 mm (PC). The accuracy has improved twice due to fine stage processing. Thealgorithm took about 1 second for coarse and 4 seconds for fine processing on P4,2.5 GHz. CONCLUSION: The use of anatomical and radiological knowledge includingvariability in algorithm formulation aids in localization of structures moreaccurately and robustly. This fully automatic algorithm is potentially useful inclinical setting and for research.",16399031,16399031
7084787977243506621,16399030,Academic radiology,Nowinski WL,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: This study explores morphological relationships andstructural variability of the corpus callosum (CC), fornix (Fo), anterior (AC),and posterior commissures (PC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: These structures areextracted automatically on the midsagittal plane. The CC and Fo are modeled usingbest-fit ellipses. The parameters characterizing these structures andrelationships among them are points, distances, angles, and eccentricities. Theminimum, maximum and mean values, standard deviations, and coefficients ofvariation for all parameters are calculated for 62 diversified MRI datasets.Subsequently, the regression analysis and parameter distribution study areperformed. RESULTS: The parameters have at least 10% variations. The major axisof CC and eccentricities of CC and Fo vary much less than the other parametersThe major axis of CC is approximately parallel to the AC-PC line. The meaneccentricity of each of CC and Fo is greater than 0.95. The most significantcorrelation (P < .05) is observed between various angles and the angle betweenthe major axes of CC and Fo. The correlation is also significant between otherangles and distances. The Weibull distribution characterizes the major axis ofCC, and distance between the AC and the most superior point of CC. Distributionof angle between the major axes of CC and Fo is log (logistic), and normal forthe AC-PC distance. CONCLUSIONS: The AC-PC distance, used prevalently for brainnormalization, is not correlated with any parameters except with the distancebetween the AC and the most superior point on the body of the CC with P < .05.",16399030,16399030
7084787977243506621,16399029,Academic radiology,Gefter WB,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Serial CT lung studies are difficult to compare due tomisregistration between image sets. An optical flow method (OFM) was adapted foruse on CT lung images to register images and visualize changes between studies.Three applications were investigated: lung nodule assessment; evaluation ofpulmonary enhancement; and functional changes due to air trapping. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: From an initial clinical study, a follow-up study was created bydigitally manipulating the images to simulate patient positioning errors andnodule growth. Nodule growth was measured from the temporal subtraction ofregistered images. In application to the assessment of pulmonary enhancement, preand postcontrast images from a patient with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) wereregistered. A map of the perfused blood volume was computed from the ratio ofaligned lung volumes. Functional changes in the lung were demonstrated usingimages from a patient with air trapping. End-inspiratory and end-expiratoryvolumes were aligned and displacement fields estimated using the OFM. Principalstrains were computed from the displacement fields. RESULTS: All image volumeswere aligned with at least 0.95 correlation. OFM estimates of displacement showedexcellent agreement with the prescribed displacements with 0.33 pixel RMS error.Nodule growth was evident in the presence of significant positioning errors. Inthe PE case, enhancement ratios indicated a hypoperfused area consistent with anocclusive hypodense filling defect. For the air trapping case, a strain mapshowed functional changes along the interface of the air trap. CONCLUSIONS: TheOFM can facilitate the detection and quantification of changes between serial CTlung studies.",16399029,16399029

MATERIALS AND METHODS:Forty mice, 20 with Lyme arthritis and 20 controls, were examined. Twononspecific NIR carbocyanine dyes, indocyanine green (ICG) and a hydrophiliccarbocyanine derivative (1,1'-bis-[4-sulfobutyl]indotricarbocyanine-5,5'-dicarboxylic acid diglucamide monosodium salt [SIDAG]),were administered intravenously at two doses. Fluorescence images were acquiredbefore and during 120 seconds after injection of cyanine dyes. For both dyes, thearea under the curve (AUC) was determined for the interval between 40 and 80seconds after injection. In addition, the slope of the signal decrease wascompared among animal groups. Results were compared with histological findings.RESULTS: The general temporal fluorescence intensity course for ICG wascharacterized by a rapid increase, with a peak at 40-50 seconds followed by adecrease; conversely for SIDAG, by a slow increase. AUC analysis for both dyesshowed that the fluorescence signal differed significantly between controls andarthritic animals (P < .05). Within these groups, there were significantdifferences between the two doses investigated. ICG differed significantlybetween control and arthritic animals in the slope of the signal decrease forboth doses investigated (P < .05). Histological examination showed early stagesof inflammation in arthritic animals. CONCLUSIONS: NIR fluorescence imaging basedon the pharmacokinetic behavior of ICG or SIDAG is a promising approach to detectinflammatory joint changes of experimental arthritis.

The detection of intermolecular forces in thepiconewton range has paved the way to investigate details on structuralparameters of the binding pockets and the energy landscapes of many biomolecularinteractions. The capability of AFM to resolve nanometer-sized details, togetherwith its force detection sensitivity, led to the development of molecularrecognition imaging.

METHODS: Wemerged previously developed costs per victim by abbreviated injury scale (AIS)score into U.S. crash data files that scored injuries in both the AIS andpolice-coded severity scales to estimate injury costs, then aggregated theestimates into costs per crash by maximum injury severity. RESULTS: The mostcostly crashes were non-intersection fatal/disabling injury crashes on a roadwith a speed limit of 50 miles per hour or higher where multiple vehicles crashedhead-on or a single vehicle struck a human (over 1.69 US dollars and 1.16 millionUS dollars per crash, respectively).

Head-on crashes on these roads account for less than5% of the crashes, but they are responsible for almost half of all fatalities.Data analyzed in this study was provided by Maine Department of Transportationand covers all head-on crashes for 2000-2002 during which period there were 3,136head-on crashes reported. Out of these, 127 were fatal crashes and 235 producedincapacitating but not fatal injuries. These two categories made up over 75% ofthe crash cost. A clear majority of head-on crashes on two-lane, rural roads inMaine were caused by drivers making errors or misjudging situations.Illegal/unsafe speed was a factor in 32% of the crashes while driverinattention/distraction was a primary factor in 28%. Fatigue was responsible foraround one in 40 crashes and one in 12 fatal crashes. Alcohol or drugs was afactor in one in 12 crashes and one in nine fatal head-on crashes. Less than 8%of fatalities involved someone overtaking another vehicle, and only around 14%involved a driver intentionally crossing the centerline. Two in three fatalhead-on crashes occurred on straight segments and 67% of these happened on drypavement. There is a clear trend towards higher speed limits leading to a higherpercentage of crashes becoming fatal or having incapacitating injuries. There isalso a clear trend - if one keeps speeds constant and AADT within a certain range- that wider shoulders give higher crash severities. Also, for higher-speedroads, more travel lanes (than two) increase crash severity. In summary, thereseems to be two major reasons why people get across the centerline and havehead-on collisions: (a) people are going too fast for the roadway conditions; or(b) people are inattentive and get across the centerline more or less withoutnoticing it. The latter category of crashes could probably be reduced ifcenterline rumble-strips were installed. More or less all head-on collisionscould be eliminated if median barriers were installed. In-vehicle technologycould also be used to significantly reduce the incidence of lane departures.Furthermore, today's speed limits should be better enforced since a highpercentage of serious crashes involve illegal speeding. This should be combinedwith lowered speed limits for targeted high-crash segments.",16423319,16423319

This paperinvestigates median barrier crash frequency on Pennsylvania Interstate highways,including separate models for the Turnpike and all other Interstate-designatedhighways. Negative binomial regression models were used to develop predictivecrash frequency tools. Traffic volume, horizontal alignment, interchange ramppresence, and median barrier offset distance from the travel lanes were used toestimate median barrier crash frequency. The analytical methodology developed inthis research can be used, in concert with other prediction models, to assess theconsequences of median barrier placement decisions.",16442487,16442487

Safety climateis an organizational factor commonly cited as a predictor of injury occurrence.Characterized by the shared perceptions of employees, safety climate can beviewed as a snapshot of the prevailing state of safety in the organization at adiscrete point in time. However, few studies have elaborated plausible mechanismsthrough which safety climate likely influences injury occurrence. A mediatingmodel is proposed to link safety climate (i.e., management commitment to safety,return-to-work policies, post-injury administration, and safety training) withself-reported injury through employees' perceived control on safety. Factorialevidence substantiated that management commitment to safety, return-to-workpolicies, post-injury administration, and safety training are importantdimensions of safety climate. In addition, the data support that safety climateis a critical factor predicting the history of a self-reported occupationalinjury, and that employee safety control mediates the relationship between safetyclimate and occupational injury. These findings highlight the importance ofincorporating organizational factors and workers' characteristics in efforts toimprove organizational safety performance.",16442068,16442068

Based on 33 companies,we assessed its association with injury rates using three rate based injurymeasures (claims per 100 employees, claims per 100,000 h worked, and claims per 1million US dollars payroll), which were derived from workers' compensation injuryclaims. Linear regression models were used to test the predictability of safetyclimate on injury rates, followed by controlling for differences in hazard acrossindustries gauged by national industry-specific injury rates. In the unadjustedmodel, company level safety climate were negatively and significantly associatedwith injury rates. However, all of the above associations were no longer apparentwhen controlling for the hazardousness of the specific industry. These findingsmay be due to over adjustment of hazard risk, or the overwhelming effects ofindustry specific hazards relative to safety climate effects that could not bedifferentiated with the statistical power in our study.

The updating procedures examined include the Bayesianupdating approach and the application of calibration factors to the 1996 models.Models calibrated for the 2001 samples were also explored, but were found to beinadequate. The results show that the models are not transferable in a strictstatistical sense.

For understandingthe injury circumstances 250 in-depth interviews of the injured or the closerelatives were also conducted. RESULTS: Among 1182 households, having 9891residents, 84 minor, 42 major injury episodes, 7 hospitalizations, 0.6 permanentdisabilities and 0.3 deaths per 1000 person years were reported. Including allinjury episodes, the common types of injury were cutting or piercing (n = 532),falls (n = 382) and burns (n = 235) estimating to 54, 38 and 23 injury episodesper 1000 person years. Injury mainly resulted from a piece of glass (n = 367),falling from height (n = 98) and knife (n = 97) estimating to 37, 10 and 10injury episodes per 1000 person years, respectively. Fall (n = 32, 3.2/1000person years) was the major reason for hospitalizations and all permanentdisabilities resulted from closed injuries.

Multiple logistic regression techniques wereemployed using the available data for the Kentucky licensed drivers. This studyconsiders as crash predictors the driver's total number of previous crashes,citations accumulated, the time gap between the latest two crashes, crash type,and demographic factors. The driver's total number of previous crashes wasfurther disaggregated into the drivers' total number of previous at-fault andnot-at-fault crashes. The model can be used to correctly classify at-faultdrivers up to 74.56% with an overall efficiency of 63.34%. The total number ofprevious at-fault crash involvements, and having previous driver licensesuspensions and traffic school referrals are strongly associated with a driverbeing responsible for a subsequent crash. In addition, a driver's likelihood tobe at fault in a crash is higher for very young or very old, males, drivers withboth speeding and non-speeding citations, and drivers that had a recent crashinvolvement.

First, there is a presumption in the road safety arena that the expectedincrease in the number of ageing drivers on the roads will lead to an increase incrashes. Second, despite extensive research on ageing drivers, especially ontheir increased vulnerability and reduced driving abilities, the most widelyrecommended road safety strategy relates to the control of their drivinglicenses. This presumption and the associated policy recommendation are basedmainly on the higher relative crash risks associated with ageing drivers comparedto their younger counterparts. This study, however, argues that the average crashrisks obtained in previous studies provide only indirect information concerningthese issues and any decision based on these results may produce unexpectedoutcomes. An analytical framework to examine the marginal effect of changing thedriver mix on the roads is proposed and a simple empirical model is estimated asan illustration.

Further, interactions ofolder females with other factors, such as occupant seat position, crash type, andenvironmental factors were also shown to significantly impact the relative riskof a severe injury. This study revealed that females 75 years and older had thelowest odds of injury among all female occupants studied (OR=1.16) while femalesbetween 55 and 74 years old have higher risk of severe injuries (OR=1.74). Allolder females (55 and older) were at greater risk for head-on, side-impact andrear-end collisions. Seatbelt use reduced severe injuries for females in this agegroup, but not to the same extent as the rest of the population studied.Additionally, crashes in severe weather, which were less likely to result insevere injuries for the general population, increased the risk of severe injuriesto females that were 55 and older. Among occupants of light trucks, sport utilityvehicles and vans, older females were less likely than others to be severelyinjured.

Data were collected from 23 countries, based on representative nationalsamples of at least 1000 respondents each (n=24,372). Face-to-face interviewswith fully licensed, active car drivers were conducted using a questionnairecontaining closed answer questions. Respondents were asked to rate 15 causes ofroad accidents, each using a six-point ordinal scale.

The group space of the model comprises fourquadrants, each containing several items (high perceived risk/low perceivedprevalence items; high perceived risk/high perceived prevalence items; lowperceived risk/high perceived prevalence items and low perceived risk/lowperceived prevalence items). Finally, perceptions of the items driving under theinfluence of alcohol, drugs and medicines and driving using a handheld orhands-free mobile phone are discussed with regard to their real significance incausing road accidents. To conclude, individual difference scaling offers somepromising possibilities to study drivers' perception of road accident causes.",16191426,16191426

METHODS:The study uses 1992-2002 data on motor vehicle fatalities among 15-17-year-olddrivers from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System to identify the effects of""good"", ""fair"", and ""marginal"" GDL programs based upon designations by theInsurance Institute for Highway Safety. Analysis is conducted using conditionalnegative binomial regressions with fixed effects. RESULTS: ""Good"" programs reducetotal fatalities among young drivers by 19.4% (c.i. -33.0%, -5.9%). ""Fair""programs reduce night-time young driver fatalities by 12.6% (c.i. -23.9%, -1.2%),but have no effect on day-time fatalities. ""Marginal"" programs had nostatistically meaningful effect on driver fatalities. All three types of programsreduced teen passenger fatalities, but the effects of limitations on the numberof passengers appear to have had only minimal effects in reducing fatalitiesamong young drivers themselves. CONCLUSIONS: Stronger GDL programs are moreeffective than weaker programs in reducing teenage motor vehicle fatalities.",16171767,16171767

Thecriterion outcome indicators were: (1) monthly motor vehicle casualties (majorinjuries and fatalities) for the city-regions of Windsor and Detroit and (2)Ontario and Michigan monthly motor vehicle fatalities occurring between 11:00p.m. and 3:00 a.m. for 4 years pre- and 3 years post-policy change. In order toexamine cross-border drinking consequences, data were disaggregated to assesstrends of motor vehicle injury collisions involving vehicles with US licenceplates and with US drivers aged 16-20 in the Windsor region; similarly trendswere assessed for motor vehicle injury collisions involving vehicles with Ontariolicence plates in the Detroit region. RESULTS: The Windsor region total motorvehicle casualty data showed a non-significant pre-post increase, while theDetroit region showed a statistically significant decrease for total motorvehicle casualties. In the Windsor region, a significant increase was found foralcohol-related motor vehicle casualties after the drinking hours were extended.However, the Detroit region showed a statistically significant decrease inalcohol-related motor vehicle casualties concomitant with Ontario's drinking hourextension. No similar trends were found for the province of Ontario and the stateof Michigan as a whole. Moreover, a significant decrease was found for injurycollisions involving vehicles with Ontario licence plates in the Detroit regionbut no similar pattern was found for injury collisions involving vehicles with USlicence plates and with 16-20-year-old US drivers in the Windsor region.DISCUSSION: These data seem to support a cross-border impact of the Ontarioextended drinking policy. A significant increase in alcohol-related motor vehiclecasualties was found in the Windsor region and concomitantly, significantdecreases in total and alcohol-related motor vehicle casualties were found in theDetroit region after the extended drinking hours amendment. The Ontariogovernment's belief that the extended drinking hour policy would ""reduce thenumber of patrons who cross the border when Ontario's bars and restaurants close""may have been realized.",16169506,16169506

STUDY DESIGN ANDSETTING: A hospital discharge register study on the hospitalisation for injurieswith a follow-up of 213509-person-years. RESULTS: During the 10-year studyperiod, altogether 20016 hospitalisations for injuries were registered. Over thisperiod, the annual incidence of hospitalisation for injuries declined with 26%,from 113.3 (95% CI: 108.7-118.0) per 1000 conscripts in 1990 to 84.1 (95% CI:80.0-88.2) in 1999. Summer and autumn were the seasons with the highest incidencerates. Half of the injuries were sprains, strains, or fractures, and in half ofthe injuries, the anatomical location involved was the lower limb. The leadingexternal causes of injuries were falls (31.8%) and injuries inflicted by foreignobjects or machinery (18.5%).

Sensortechnology that can detect such obstacles and that also is designed for surfacemining applications is rare. Researchers worked closely with the radar systemmanufacturer to test and modify the system on large, off-highway dump trucks at asurface mine over a period of 2 years. The final system was thoroughly evaluatedby recording video images from a camera on the rear of the truck and by recordingall alarms from the rear-mounted radar. Data show that the system reliablydetected small vehicles, berms, people and other equipment.

The number of sub-clusters per cluster is small, with lessthan two cars per crash and less than two occupants per car, whereas the numberof clusters can be high, with several hundred/thousand crashes. Application ofthe Monte-Carlo method on observed and simulated French road crash data between1996 and 2000 allows comparing estimations produced by multilevel logistic models(MLM), Generalized Estimating Equation models (GEE) and logistic models (LM). Onthe strength of a bias study, MLM is the most efficient model while both GEE andLM underestimate parameters and confidence intervals. MLM is used as a marginalmodel and not as a random-effect model, i.e. only fixed effects are taken intoaccount. Random effects allow adjusting risks on the hierarchical structure,conferring an interpretative advantage to MLM over GEE. Nevertheless, great careis needed for data coding and quite a high number of crashes are necessary inorder to avoid problems and errors with estimates and estimate processes. Onbalance, MLM must be used when the number of vehicles per crash or the number ofoccupants per vehicle is high, when the LM results are questionable because theyare not in line with the literature or finally when the p-values associated torisk measures are close to 5%.

An appropriatemodel for this type of data was the Poisson regression model, with a Poissonerror distribution, a log link function and the natural log of population treatedas an 'offset'. It was found that there was no change in the age-standardisedrate of spinal cord injury. However, an assessment of specific rates by age, sex,cause and neurological group revealed some contrasting trends, notably decliningrates in young males, transport-related injury and complete tetraplegia, andincreasing rates in elderly males, fall-related injury and incomplete tetraplegiaand complete paraplegia. These changes are considered to reflect the impact of araft of public health measures directed at transport-related injury but a paucityof prevention programs directed at fall-related spinal cord injury. More researchis required to determine the causes of the increasing rate of elderly malefall-related spinal cord injury.

Therefore, focus group discussions were conducted to explore driverattitudes and safe driver characteristics. The results were then compared with asimilar study conducted with US drivers. Although similarities were found,differences were of more importance. The Chinese drivers concentrate more ondriving skills and capabilities, whereas the US drivers concentrate more onpractical safe driving guidelines. Then direct field observations were conductedfor the Chinese drivers to empirically investigate the issues discovered. The useof safety belts, running lights, headlights, and turn signals were observed toinvestigate the drivers' behaviors. Results show that the safety belt use ratiois about 64%, running light use is nearly zero during rainy and snowy weather,headlights use after sunset is substantially delayed, and only about 40% ofdrivers use turn signals to indicate their intention to change lanes.

METHODS: Probabilistic data recordlinkage were used to merge police crash records and workers compensation data forthe period 1998-2002. RESULTS: The record linkage identified 13,124 drivers whowere injured or died as a result of work-related traffic crash in New South Walesover the 5-year period. Approximately three quarters of driver casualtiesoccurred during commuting (74.8%) with the rest occurring in the course of work.Male drivers made up around three quarters of these crashes and 93% of those thatresulted in a fatality. Transport workers were the most frequent victims ofwork-related crashes while on duty (20.8%), with drivers of heavy trucksrepresenting about half (48%) of all fatalities resulting from on dutywork-related crashes. Nearly 1 in 6 male drivers were speeding at the time of thecrash (15%, 95% CI 14.2-15.7) compared to less than 1 in 10 female drivers (9%,95% CI 8.3-9.8) of female drivers.

Research has shown the accident and emergency (A&E)department to be a particularly problematic environment where safety is a concerndue to various factors, such as the range, nature and urgency of presentingconditions and the high turnover of patients. As in all healthcare environmentsclinical incident reporting in A&E is an important tool for detecting safetyissues which can result in identifying solutions, learning from error andenhancing patient safety. This tool must be responsive and flexible to the localcircumstances and work for the department to support the clinical governanceagenda. In this paper, we describe the local processes for reporting andreviewing clinical incidents in one A&E department in a London teaching hospitaland report recent changes to the system within the department. We used thehistorical data recorded on the Trust incident database as a representation ofthe information that would be available to the department in order to identifythe high risk areas. In this paper, we evaluate the internal processes, theinformation available on the database and make recommendations to assist theemergency department in their internal processes. These will strengthen theinternal review and staff feedback system so that the department can learn fromincidents in a consistent manner. The process was reviewed by detailedexamination of the centrally held electronic record (Datix database) of allincidents reported in a one year period. The nature of the incident and the leveland accuracy of information provided in the incident reports was evaluated. Therewere positive aspects to the established system including evidence of positivechanges made as a result of the reporting process, new initiatives to feedback tostaff, and evolution of the programme for reporting and discussing the incidentsinternally. There appeared to be a mismatch between the recorded events and thecategory allocated to the incident in the historical record. In addition thedatabase did not contain complete information for every incident, contributoryfactors were rarely recorded and relatively large numbers of incidents wererecorded as ""other"" in the type of incident. There was also observed difficultyin updating the system as there is at least a months time lag between reportingor an incident and discussion/resolution of issues at the local departmentalclinical risk management committee meetings. We used Leape's model for assessingthe reporting system as a whole and found the system in the department to berelatively safe, fairly easy to use and moderately effective. Recommendations asa result of this study include the introduction of an electronic reportingsystem, limiting the number of staff who categorise the incidents--using cleardefinitions for classifications including a structured framework for contributoryfactors, and a process that allows incidents to be updated on the databaselocally after the discussion.

Of particular note,the proposed compliance branch consists of a number of independent national andregional Research Ethics Boards (i.e., REBs no longer reside withininstitutions). There is also an Audit Committee and a Non-compliance Committee(with supporting staff of auditors and compliance officers) to ensure compliancewith the policies and standards set by the Policy and Standards Branch. Finally,I answer a series of ""frequently asked questions"" about the proposed agencydesign such as ""What about 'local context'?"" and ""Why not have a system ofaccreditation of institutional REBs instead?"" In sum, radical reform is neededand, in this paper, I present a proposal for such reform.",16770860,16770860

On the negative side it has been presented ascumbersome, expensive, time consuming, and potentially a system that does notadequately deal with the concerns it was set up to address. One common, but oftencontroversial, proposal to address some of these concerns has been theinstitutionalization of centralized systems of review. This paper uses data onthe review systems in place in five countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand,the USA and the U.K.), some with and some without versions of centralized review,to explore issues related to centralization of the review process. It suggeststhat there are at least three types of systems (fully centralized, dual, anddecentralized or multicommittee) in place; all are made up of two, interrelatedcomponents (the administrative and ethics review). We suggest that bothcomponents need to be considered in discussions about centralized review. Seriousconsideration of centralization of the administrative component may address manyconcerns. Centralization of the ethics review may provide a context that dealswith other issues and may encourage reviews that more effectively focus on theethical issues involved.",16770859,16770859

Thecomplexity of research has expanded, requiring increasingly specialized knowledgeto review it. Dilemma: Under the current system, increasing numbers of researchstudies requiring expertise in ethics, new technologies or diverse study designsplace a substantial burden upon local IRBs and often result in substantialvariability among their reviews. This lack of uniformity in the review processcreates uneven human subjects' protection thus undermining the intent of theCommon Rule. Objectives: To outline a scenario for expert centralized IRB reviewvia implementation of a national virtual IRB review system overseen by the Officefor Human Research Protections (OHRP). Conclusions: The complicated ethicalissues and science involved in much of current research warrant an expert reviewpanel. Centralized review would enable expert review specific to the research athand, ensure consistency in human subjects protection, reduce the burden on localIRBs, and may reduce time spent obtaining approval. A centralized virtual systemwould allow IRB members to remain at their institutions while providingunprecedented expert review through currently available technology, and makeinformation regarding monitoring and adverse event reporting available online inreal-time.",16770858,16770858

However, very few clinical trials have studied the longterm impact ofintraoperative epidural or spinal analgesia on chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP)development. Even less studies have evaluated the modulatory effect ofintraoperative neuraxial analgesia on objective changes (i.e. mechanicalhyperalgesia) reflecting central sensitization. METHODS: The present workcompares general anesthesia alone (GA group) versus general anesthesia combinedto either intraoperative epidural analgesia (EPID group: combination ofbupicavaine, sufentanil and clonidine 1 microg/kg) or spinal analgesia (IT group:either bupivacaine or clonidine 300 microg) on the development of secondarymechanical hyperalgesia and the incidence of CPSP after major abdominal surgery.Data analyzed in the present work involve adult patients undergoing surgicalresection of rectal adenocarcinoma who participated in three previously publishedrandomized trials. RESULTS: Intraoperative epidural and particularly spinalanalgesia reduced both incidence (p < 0.05 between GA alone and spinal analgesia)and extent (area) of secondary mechanical hyperalgesia surrounding the wound at48h and 72 h after surgery. The use of intraoperative epidural and spinalanalgesia also reduced CPSP incidence. Postoperative area of mechanicalhyperalgesia seems positively correlated with the incidence CPSP. CONCLUSION: Aneffective intraoperative neuraxial block of nociceptive inputs from the woundusing multimodal analgesia--specifically when involving spinal analgesics andantihyperalgesic drugs--contributes to prevent central sensitization and hencereduces CPSP after major abdominal procedures.",17236639,17236639

Treatment and prevention of PONV requires accurate riskstratification. The simplified Apfel-score includes the four factors femalegender, no smoking, postoperative use of opioides and previous PONV ormotion-sickness in patients' history. Each of these risk factors is supposed toelevate the PONV-incidence about 20%. The aim of the study was to validate thisclinical risk assessment score in patients with high risk for PONV. METHODS: In aprospective study 93 patients with high risk preoperative score for PONV (ApfelScore III and IV) were analyzed. Patients and nurses were interviewed using astandardized questionnaire at the time of discharge from the post-anesthesia careunit (PACU) as well as 6 hours and 24 hours after admission to the PACU. Generalanaesthesia was applied as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with mivacurium,propofol and remifentanil (no nitrous oxide / FI 02 0.5) RESULTS: In the groupwith Apfel score III PONV occurred in 59.7% of patients and in the Apfel scoregroup IV in 91.3% of all patients. The incidence of PONV corresponds to thepredicted values of 60% for Apfel III and 80% for Apfel IV although the use ofTIVA should have reduced the incidence of PONV about 26%. This apparentoverestimation could be explained by the frequent questioning of patients andnurses for PONV leading to assessment of very minor symptoms. CONCLUSION: TheApfel-score is a useful and simple tool for stratification of patients with highrisk for PONV.",17236637,17236637

Itis unknown, however, whether analgesic state can influence this memoryprocessing. Twenty healthy adult volunteers were enrolled our prospective,double-blinded, controlled experiments. Anesthesia was induced with a propofoltarget controlled infusion (TCI), titrated in step-wise increments to loss ofconsciousness. In phase A, a 10-word list was played to the subjects while anoxious stimulus was applied (hand immersion in cold water at 2-4 degrees C). Inphase B, a remifentanil TCI infusion was added to the steady-state propofol TCIanesthesia, and titrated to loss of hand movement on cold water immersion. Asecond 10-word list was then played while maintaining the hand in cold water.Memory testing, 2 hours post-recovery revealed no evidence of explicit memory inany subject during either phase of the study. During phase A, the word stemcompletion test revealed implicit learning for played words. In contrast, noimplicit memory was detected during phase B.

Although hydroxyethylstarch(HES) is preferred over crystalloid for prevention of hypotension during regionalanesthesia, the pharmacokinetics of bupivacaine during fluid preloading has notbeen studied. METHODS: Twenty-four awake Sprague-Dawley rats were randomlyallocated to receive the continuous intravenous infusion of HES 70K, 200K or400K, or normal saline (NS). After 1 hour of prehydration all animals receivedbupivacaine, 1mg kg(-1), bolus, followed by a continuous infusion, 0.4mg kg(-1)min(-1) for 15 minutes. After the completion of bupivacaine infusion serialarterial blood samples to determine the plasma bupivacaine concentration wereobtained. The plasma concentration-time profile of bupivacaine was fitted to atwo-compartment open model, and the estimated intercepts and slopes were used forcalculation of standard pharmacokinetic parameters. RESULTS: The mean peakbupivacaine concentration during HES 400K infusion was significantly lower thanduring NS infusion (1488 +/- 302 ng ml(-1) vs 2388 +/- 582 ng ml(-1)). Meanvolume of distribution in each of the three HES groups was greater than in NSgroup.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: PPSB-SD is a concentrate prothrombincomplex containing a relatively constant high level of vitamin K-dependantcoagulation factors II, VII, IX and X. PPSB-SD was administered to 14 patientstreated with oral anticoagulants, according the patient's weight, the initial andthe target INR (< 2.0 for moderate haemorrhage and abdominal surgery, or < 1.5for severe haemorrhage and cardio-vascular interventions). INR values weremeasured with the Coagucheck Pro (Roche Diagnostics) upon admission and at 15minutes, 1, 3 and 5 hours after treatment, and confirmed by the hospitals'laboratory. RESULTS: Within 15 minutes 11 patients out of 12 reached their INRtarget (data were missing for 2 patients). INR decreased rapidly, then remainedstable for the next 5 hours. All patients had a favourable outcome: bleeding wasstopped and no haemorrhage occurred during surgery. Only one adverse event wasreported, but it was not related to the PPSB-SD treatment. No sign ofdisseminated intravascular coagulation was observed during this study. Theadministration of PPSB-SD along with vitamin K and dosed according to body weightand initial and target INR allowed for optimal reversal of anticoagulation, as nosecond infusion was necessary. The recommended dosing worked also very well forpatients with high initial INR (9.2 to 22.8) who were brought down to normalvalues (0.9 to 1.1) within 15 minutes.

Thepatient became acutely cyanotic and edematous in the face and upper extremities,arterial blood pressure dropped and the venous pressure in the right internaljugular vein was elevated. Drugs for managing the patient were givenendobronchially and via an established right atrium line. Postoperatively, noneurologic deficit was noted. This case demonstrates the difficulties formanaging patients without superior vena cava syndrome in which acute,non-programmed intra-operative SVC clamping is performed, as this is followed bysystemic and brain hemodynamic deteriorations that may lead to bad outcome.",16617761,16617761

The clinical relevanceof this difference is not yet clear. METHODS: In a double-blind randomised trialbupivacaine and ropivacaine each at 0.125% with 1 microg/ml fentanyl werecompared for epidural labour analgesia. This study was performed in twouniversity hospitals. RESULTS: Sixty-three nulliparous women with singletonpregnancies at term were included. There were no differences between bupivacaineand ropivacaine as far as motor blockade, analgesic outcome, mode of delivery andneonatal outcome are concerned. However, the clinical management of epiduralanalgesia differed significantly between the two institutions involved.Parturients of one institution had their epidural catheter placed earlier, neededless top-up medication, and had more successful mobilisations, when compared tothe other institution. CONCLUSIONS: Institutional clinical practice can besignificantly different. Pharmacological differences between bupivacaine andropivacaine at 0.125% with 1 microg/ml fentanyl seem to be less important thandifferences between institutions in terms of clinical practice.",16617757,16617757

During the induction of combined spinal-epiduralanesthesia, 91 elective Cesarean section patients were randomly assigned toreceive a spinal injection of either 10 mg ropivacaine or 6.6 mg bupivacaine orlevobupivacaine both combined with sufentanil 3.3 microg. After securing theepidural catheter patients were turned to the supine position respecting a 15degrees left lateral tilt. The three local anesthetics were compared with respectto sensory and motor block, the need for epidural supplementation, the severityof hypotension and neonatal outcome. More patients in bupivacaine had a Bromage-3motor block at incision. The ropivacaine group required additional localanesthetics by the epidural route in 23% of the cases versus 10% in thebupivacaine group and 9% with levobupivacaine. This caused the interval betweenthe spinal injection and the end of surgery to be longer in the ropivacainegroup. Hemodynamic values were comparable between the three groups although atrend towards better systolic blood pressures and a lower incidence of severehypotension were noticed in favor of levobupivacaine. Apgar scores and umbilicalpH values did not differ. When performing a low-dose combined spinal-epiduraltechnique for Cesarean section, the present study confirms that the new localanesthetics can be used successfully, induce less motor block but thatropivacaine requires at least a 50% larger dose than bupivacaine orlevobupivacaine.",16617756,16617756

In2003, every 20th Norwegian used an ACE inhibitor. CASE REPORT: A 61-year-oldwoman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a past acute myocardialinfarction had used 7.5 mg of ramipril daily for the past 7 years. She also usedacetylsalicylic acid, simvastatin, theophylline and salmeterol. One night shewoke up with edema of the tongue. On hospital arrival, 250 mg of hydrocortisoneand 5 mg of dexchlorpheniramine were given intravenously (i.v.) and 0.3 mg ofepinephrine was given subcutaneously (s.c.). The edema of the tongue progressedover the next 8 h and made the tongue protrude. Fiberscopy revealed glassy edemaof the arytenoids. Inspiratory stridor was heard and the patient could not speak.She became increasingly uneasy and restless. Berinert complement 1 (C1) inhibitorconcentrate (1500 units) was administered i.v. Over the following 20 min, stridorgradually subsided, the patient calmed and she was able to talk. DISCUSSION: ACEinhibitor-provoked angioedema shares many clinical features with hereditaryangioedema (HAE), including a limited effect of steroids, antihistamines andepinephrine. HAE, caused by excess bradykinin formation as a result of C1inhibitor deficiency, usually has its laryngeal edema effectively reversed by C1inhibitor in less than 0.5 h. Although patients experiencing ACEinhibitor-provoked angioedema have normal C1 inhibitor values, as in our patient,excess bradykinin is probably important as ACE breaks down bradykinin. It isunknown why ACE inhibitor-provoked angioedema appears in some and sometimes aftermany years of use. CONCLUSION: We believe that C1 inhibitor was effective inreversing the ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema in our patient.",16451161,16451161

We hypothesized that with this technique, block onsettime and effectiveness are better than with a conventional catheter technique,and designed a study comparing this new technique with a conventional singleinjection through a catheter. METHODS: Fifty-one adult patients were included ina prospective study. In all patients, a short axillary plexus catheter waspositioned close to the median nerve. All patients had an injection through thecatheter, while 26 of the patients had an additional injection behind, and infront of, the axillary artery. Sensory and motor block were tested continuouslyevery minute for 29 min. Block success was recorded as onset time to analgesia,anaesthesia and complete motor block in the first 29 min. At 30 and 50 min, ananalgesia block score was recorded. RESULTS: The transarterial injection pluscatheter method was more effective, with a higher success rate and faster onset,than the catheter method. Readiness for surgery with analgesia in the median,radial and ulnar nerves was achieved in the catheter group in 13 patients (52%)at a mean time of 20.8 min, and in the combined group in 21 patients (81%) at amean time of 13.3 min (P<0.05, P<0.05).

Although lowmolecular weight HES (130/0.4) has been developed to minimize its influence oncoagulation, experience with HES (130/0.4) in children is limited. Therefore, weevaluated the effects of a HES (130/0.4) infusion on post-operative blood loss inchildren undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: Forty-two children undergoingcardiac surgery were assigned at random to receive either 10 ml/kg fresh frozenplasma (FFP group; n=21) or HES (130/0.4) (HES group; n=21) shortly aftercardiopulmonary bypass termination. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)and international normalization ratio (INR) were measured. In addition,post-operative transfusion requirements and blood loss until the end of the firstpost-operative day were compared. RESULTS: INR was significantly prolonged afterHES infusion in comparison to the FFP group (P<0.05). During the first 24 h aftersurgery, post-operative blood loss, the use of allogenic blood/blood products andaPTT were similar in all children. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that theadministration of a moderate dose of HES (130/0.4) in children undergoing cardiacsurgery does not cause more bleeding or a higher transfusion requirement than aFFP infusion, and suggests that the administration of 10 ml/kg HES (130/0.4) is asafe alternative to plasma for intravascular volume replacement in this patientpopulation.",16451158,16451158

METHODS: In six anesthetized domestic pigs,the largest branch of the circumflex artery was occluded for 30 min.Microdialysate was sampled from the ischemic and non-ischemic myocardium alongwith continuous measurements of local coronary artery flow, global hemodynamicsand registration of arrhythmias, from baseline through to 30 min of ischemia and180 min of reperfusion. RESULTS: During ischemia, the microdialysate glucoseconcentration decreased, the glycerol concentration increased and thelactate/pyruvate ratio increased significantly. For glycerol, there was a furtherincrease at reperfusion. During ischemia, cardiac output was unchanged; however,during reperfusion there was a significant drop lasting for several minutes,longer than the period in which an increased number of arrhythmias wereregistered. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates deranged circulation andarrhythmias corresponding to ischemic metabolism after regional myocardialischemia and reperfusion. Reperfusion induced more pronounced circulatory changesthan the actual ischemia. A substantial increase in myocardial glycerol releaseseems to be a marker of ischemic metabolism and may prove to be an indicator ofreperfusion injury.",16451157,16451157

The primary aim of this study was to document the short-and long-term outcome of patients with a tracheostomy performed during an ICUstay. METHODS: Patients in our ICU who underwent an unplanned tracheostomybetween 1997 and 2003 were included in this analysis. The type of tracheostomy(PDT or surgical tracheostomy) and time of the procedure were registeredprospectively in our ICU database. Survival was followed using the People'sRegistry of Norway and morbidity data from the individual hospital record. Thesepatients were also compared with a group of ICU patients ventilated for more than24 h, but managed without a tracheostomy. We also compared patients who had earlytracheostomy (less than median time to procedure) with those who had latetracheostomy. RESULTS: Of the 2844 admissions (2581 patients), unplannedtracheostomy was performed during 461 admissions (16.2%) on 454 patients (17.6%).The median time to tracheostomy was 6 days. The ICU, hospital and 1-yearmortality rates were 10.8, 27.1 and 37.2%, respectively, significantly less thanthose of the group ventilated without tracheostomy. The median time todecannulation was 14 days. Patients who had early tracheostomy had a morefavourable long-term survival than those who had late tracheostomy. Noprocedure-related mortality was registered. CONCLUSIONS: In our ICU, having atracheostomy performed was associated with a favourable long-term outcome withregard to survival, and early tracheostomy improved survival in addition toconsuming less ICU resources.",16451156,16451156

We assessed the changes in respiratory mechanics and gas exchange duringARDS. We hypothesized that due to the changes in respiratory mechanics over time,ventilatory strategies based on rigid volume or pressure limits might fail toprevent overdistension throughout the disease process. METHODS: Seventeen severeARDS patients {PaO2/FiO2 10.1 (9.2-14.3) kPa; 76 (69-107) mmHg [median (25th-75thpercentiles)] and bilateral infiltrates} were studied during the acute,intermediate, and late stages of ARDS (at 1-3, 4-6 and 7 days after diagnosis).Severity of lung injury, gas exchange, and hemodynamics were assessed.Pressure-volume (PV) curves of the respiratory system were obtained, and upperand lower inflection points (UIP, LIP) and recruitment were estimated. RESULTS:(1) UIP decreased from early to established (intermediate and late) ARDS [30(28-30) cmH2O, 27 (25-30) cmH2O and 25 (23-28) cmH2O (P=0.014)]; (2) oxygenationimproved in survivors and in patients with non-pulmonary etiology in late ARDS,whereas all patients developed hypercapnia from early to established ARDS; and(3) dead-space ventilation and pulmonary shunt were larger in patients withpulmonary etiology during late ARDS. CONCLUSION: We found a decrease in UIP fromacute to established ARDS. If applied to our data, the inspiratory pressure limitadvocated by the ARDSnet (30 cmH2O) would produce ventilation over the UIP, witha consequent increased risk of overdistension in 12%, 43% and 65% of our patientsduring the acute, intermediate and late phases of ARDS, respectively. Lungprotective strategies based on fixed tidal volume or pressure limits may thus notfully avoid the risk of lung overdistension throughout ARDS.",16451155,16451155

Normothermic CPB has become more common, but itremains unknown whether it reduces post-operative lung function compared withhypothermic CPB. The aim of this study was to investigate oxygenation within thefirst 120 h after systemic hypothermia and normothermia under CPB. METHODS:Thirty patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were randomizedto either hypothermic (32 degrees C) or normothermic (36 degrees C) CPB.Oxygenation was studied by a simple method for the estimation of intrapulmonaryshunt and ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch pre-operatively and 4, 48 and 120h post-operatively by changing Fio2 in four to six steps. V/Q mismatch wasdescribed with DeltaPo2 (normal values, 0-2.38 kPa). RESULTS: Shunt and V/Qmismatch (DeltaPo2) increased post-operatively in both groups (P<0.01), with nodifferences between the groups, and with the nadir values 48 h after surgery,i.e. shunt of 15% (5.8-25%) and DeltaPo2 of 3.0 kPa (0.8-14 kPa) [values given asmedian (range)].

RESULTS: Twenty-three anesthetists (25.8%) appeared to be atrisk for burnout, and three anesthetists (3.4%) had already developed full-blownburnout syndrome. Anesthetists at risk for burnout more frequently suffered fromlimited complexity of work (P=0.001), lacking individual time control (P=0.004),lack of participation possibilities (P=0.012), and had more physical complaints(P=0.017) and greater job dissatisfaction (P=0.002) than did their colleagueswith no burnout symptoms.

The current study assessed thesensitivity and specificity of three commonly used statistical rules in a sampleof coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patients and healthy non-surgicalcontrols. METHODS: Two hundred and four CABG patients [mean age, 68.8 years;standard deviation (SD), 7.0 years] completed neuropsychological assessmentpre-operatively (baseline) and 1 week and 3 months post-operatively. Ninety age-and gender-matched non-surgical controls (mean age, 67.8 years; SD, 7.9 years)completed the same tasks at the same time points. POCD was determined in eachgroup using three rules: the 1SD decline on two or more tasks; the 20% decline on20% of tasks rule; and a modified reliable change index. RESULTS: The modifiedreliable change index demonstrated the greatest combination of sensitivity andspecificity. The 20% decline on 20% of tasks rule detected the largest incidenceof impairment in the CABG group, but showed large incidences of false positiveclassifications in the control group. The 1SD rule detected the lowest incidenceof POCD in the CABG group, but detected a larger incidence of impairment in thecontrol group.

We investigatedwhether a common transport breathing apparatus could be modified to allowinterchange between Mapleson D (Map-D) and Mapleson A (Map A) configurations.METHODS: A common Map-D transport system was converted to a Map-A system byswitching positions of the exhaust valve and the elbow connector where fresh gasis delivered; these two breathing systems were compared in this study. The keyquestion was whether rebreathing of CO2 could be eliminated at a lower fresh gasflow rate (FGF) with the Map-A design. A structured protocol was followed.RESULTS: A mean decrease in FGF of 2.8 l/min was seen with the Map-A apparatuswhen compared with the Map-D (P=0.003). With no significant differences inphysiologic or anesthetic variables, FGF/V(E) was significantly lower with theMapleson A configuration than with the Mapleson D system design (1.1 vs. 1.8;P=0.007). The extent to which FGF could be lowered when switching betweenMapleson D and A systems correlated strongly with the patients' respiratory ratewhile under anesthesia (r=0.45, P<0.01).

METHODS: Wecompared the success of insertion, oxygenation and ventilation of the intubatinglaryngeal mask (ILMA), laryngeal tube (LT) and CobraPLA (COB) in anaesthetizedpatients when used by paramedical students. After informed consent, 96 patientswere monitored and anaesthetized for general surgery without the use of a musclerelaxant. After the induction of anaesthesia, 32 paramedical students insertedthe ILMA, LT or COB in a random order and ventilated the patient for a 60-speriod. The number of insertion attempts, the time needed for insertion, andoxygenation and ventilation parameters were recorded. The students gave asubjective evaluation of the airway devices after the test.

Activation of Response Entropy (RE) to painful stimuli has beensuggested to be a sign of inadequate analgesia. We evaluated the ability of RE tobe more sensitive than State Entropy (SE) in measuring nociception in patientsundergoing gynaecological laparoscopy. Our hypothesis was that while keeping SEat a predetermined level, RE would be higher in patients receiving abeta-blocking agent (esmolol) instead of an opioid (remifentanil) during apropofol/nitrous oxide anaesthesia. METHODS: Fifty-one women aged between 22-53years were randomly assigned to receive esmolol (n=25) or remifentanil (n=26). SEwas kept at 50+/-5. RE and SE were recorded at an interval of 30 s to 2 min andthe areas under the RE and SE value-time curves (AUCRE and AUCSE) were calculatedduring the time of intubation and start of surgery as well as during the entireanaesthesia. The difference between RE and SE recordings in both groups wasdetermined by subtracting the AUCSE from the corresponding AUCRE. Movements ofthe patients were recorded. RESULTS: No significant differences were detected inany of the several AUC values between the groups. The difference between RE andSE recordings was similar in both groups. Every patient in the esmolol groupmoved some time during the procedure interfering with surgery while no one in theremifentanil group moved. CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing gynaecologicallaparoscopic day-case surgery, RE seems not to be more sensitive than SE inguiding the use of opioids during general anaesthesia.",16451148,16451148

The aim of this study was to identify preoperative riskfactors for decreased 1- to 5-year survival rates and to compare the survivalrates of stratified risk groups with those of the sex- and age-matched generalpopulation. METHODS: Subjects were 406 patients, aged 80 years or older, whounderwent surgery with general anesthesia. Higher age, male sex, dependency indaily living, low serum albumin level, malignancy, abdominal surgery, emergencysurgery and high ASA class were analyzed for survival using univariate andmultivariate analysis with Cox's proportional hazard model. One- to 5-yearsurvival rates were estimated using life table analysis for patients divided byrisk factors. The survival data were also compared with the cumulative survivalrates of the sex- and age-matched general population. RESULTS: Multivariateanalysis identified three factors that were significantly associated withdecreased survival rates: male sex, dependency in daily living and abdominalsurgery. Long-term survival among patients older than 90 years was comparable tothose of the general population. Although improved in recent years, overallsurvival rates were much lower than expected due to poor outcome among patientsdependent in daily living and those who underwent abdominal surgery.

Overall costs were significantlyhigher in the TIVA (58.8+/-11.6 euro) than in the desflurane group (35.0+/-5.7euro). CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing prolonged surgical procedures showed afaster early recovery after desflurane/fentanyl than using TIVA, whereas stay inthe PACU and recovery of cognitive function were similar in both groups. Costs ofa TIVA regimen were significantly higher than using a desflurane-basedanaesthesia technique.",16451145,16451145

Clinical trials have been contradictory. This systematic review aimsto evaluate the available literature examining the analgesic efficacy of DM inpost-operative patients. METHODS: Twenty-eight randomized, double-blind, clinicalstudies, with 40 comparisons, including a variety of dosing regimens comparing DMtreatment with placebo, were included. Meta-analysis was intended but deemed tobe inappropriate because of the substantial difference in methodology andreporting between trials. The outcome measures (pain scores at rest, time tofirst analgesic request and supplemental analgesic consumption) were evaluatedqualitatively by significant difference (P<0.05) as reported in the originalinvestigations. RESULTS: DM did not reduce the post-operative pain score with aclinically significant magnitude. The time to first analgesic request wassignificantly prolonged in most comparisons with DM. Significant decreases insupplemental opioid consumption were observed in the majority of parenteral DMstudies and in about one-half of the oral studies. The decreases were ofquestionable clinical importance in most comparisons, although a relationshipbetween a decrease in opioid consumption and opioid-related side-effects wasestablished in some studies. CONCLUSION: Based on the studies available, DM hasthe potential to be a safe adjunctive agent to opioid analgesia in post-operativepain management, but the consistency of the potential opioid-sparing andpain-reducing effect must be questioned. Consequently, it is not possible torecommend dose regimens or routine clinical use of DM in post-operative pain. Theroute of administration may be important for the beneficial effect.",16451144,16451144

Ascorbic acid not only enhancedhemolysis, but also induced formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substancesin the presence of hemin. It has been shown that glutathione inhibitshemin-induced hemolysis by mediating hemin degradation. Erythrocytes depleted ofglutathione became very sensitive to oxidative stress induced by hemin andascorbic acid. H(2)O(2) was involved in hemin-mediated hemolysis in the presenceof ascorbic acid. However, a combination of glutathione and ascorbic acid wasmore effective in inhibiting hemolysis induced by hemin than glutathione alone.Extracellular and intracellular ascorbic acid exhibited a similar effect onhemin-induced hemolysis or inhibition of hemin-induced hemolysis by glutathione.The current study indicates that ascorbic acid might function as an antioxidantor prooxidant in hemin-mediated hemolysis, depending on whether glutathione isavailable.",16395529,16395529

Bronchial epithelial cells have been proposed tofunctionally interact with lung fibroblasts. We therefore investigated ifbronchial epithelial cells are able to synthesize CTGF. Human bronchialepithelial cells were grown to subconfluence in standard growth media.Proliferating cells grown in small airway growth media were harvested followingstarvation for up to 24 h. Expression of CTGF transcripts was measured by PCR.Immunocytochemistry was also completed using a commercially available antibody.The cells expressed readily detectable CTGF transcripts. Starvation of thesecells resulted in a quantitative decline of CTGF transcripts. Direct sequencingof the PCR product identified human CTGF. Immunocytochemistry confirmedintracellular CTGF in the cells and none in negative control cells. We concludethat bronchial epithelial cells could be a novel source of CTGF. Bronchialepithelial cell-derived CTGF could thus directly influence the deposition ofcollagen in certain fibrotic lung diseases.",16395527,16395527

To further demonstrate the roles of these elements,four fragments with lengths from -1187, -892, -589, -276 to +7 bp were fused withthe b-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene and transferred to Nicotiana tobacum,together with another four VCH3 promoter fragments with mutation in the twoinverse SA-responsive elements. The functions of each promoter fragment wereexamined by analysis of GUS activity in the transgenic tobacco root treated withSA. Enhanced GUS activity was shown in the roots of transgenic tobaccos with theVCH3 (-1187)-GUS construct containing two SA-responsive cis-acting elements andfour W-boxes. However, GUS activity directed by the VCH3 (-892)-GUS construct,containing one SA cis-acting element and four W-boxes, was reduced by up to 35%compared with that in tobaccos transformed with the VCH3 (-1187)-GUS construct,indicating that the SA cis-acting element plays an important role in SA inductionof the VCH3 promoter. Neither the m2VCH3 (-1187)-GUS nor the mVCH3 (-892)-GUSconstruct, with mutation on the SA-responsive elements, abolished the expressionof GUS activity, demonstrating that the W-boxes in the VCH3 promoter are alsoinvolved in SA induction. Histochemical analysis of GUS activity directed by eachof the eight VCH3 promoter fragments showed that GUS was expressed specificallyin vascular tissue. It was concluded that both the SA-responsive cis-actingelements and the W-boxes are important for the SA induction of the VCH3 promoter.This promoter might have a potential use in plant genetic engineering.",16395526,16395526

However, theorigin of the cells involved in this process is still not well understood. Thepresent study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that transforming growthfactor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) can induce transdifferentiation of fibroblasts intomyofibroblasts, which might play a key role in the muscularization ofnon-muscular pulmonary arterioles. It was found that mean pulmonary arterialpressure increased significantly after 7 d of hypoxia. Pulmonary arteryremodeling index and right ventricular hypertrophy became evident after 14 d ofhypoxia. The distribution of nonmuscular, partially muscular, and muscularvessels was significantly different after 7 d of hypoxia. Immunocytochemistryresults demonstrated that the expression of a-smooth muscle actin was increasedin intra-acinar pulmonary arteries with increasing hypoxic time. TGF-beta1 mRNAexpression in pulmonary arterial walls was increased significantly after 14 d ofhypoxia, but showed no obvious changes after 3 or 7 d of hypoxia. In pulmonarytunica adventitia and tunica media, TGF-beta1 protein staining was poorlypositive in control rats, but was markedly enhanced after 3 d of hypoxia,reaching its peak after 7 d of hypoxia. The myofibroblast phenotype was confirmedby electron microscopy, which revealed microfilaments and a well-developed roughendoplasmic reticulum. Taken together, our results suggested that TGF-beta1induces transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, which isimportant in hypoxic pulmonary vascular remodeling.",16395524,16395524

Small interfering RNA (siRNA), an intermediate of theRNAi pathway, has been shown to be very effective in inhibiting virus infectionin mammalian cells and cultured plant cells. Here, we report that Agrobacteriumtumefaciens-mediated transient expression of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) couldinhibit tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) RNA accumulation by targeting the geneencoding the replication-associated 126 kDa protein in intact plant tissue. Ourresults indicate that transiently expressed shRNA efficiently interfered with TMVinfection. The interference observed is sequence-specific, and time- andsite-dependent. Transiently expressed shRNA corresponding to the TMV 126 kDaprotein gene did not inhibit cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), an unrelatedtobamovirus. In order to interfere with TMV accumulation in tobacco leaves, it isessential for the shRNA constructs to be infiltrated into the same leaves as TMVinoculation. Our results support the view that RNAi opens the door for noveltherapeutic procedures against virus diseases.

Seventeen Wistar rats wererandomly divided into a control group (n=5), a hypoxia group (n=7), and ahypoxia+L-Arg group (n=5). The morphologic changes of lung tissues were observedunder optical microscope. Using the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling assay,the apoptosis of PASMC was examined. Fas expression in PASMC was examined usingimmunohistochemistry. The results showed that the percentage of muscularizedartery in small pulmonary vessels, and the relative medial thickness and relativemedial area of the small and median pulmonary muscularized arteries in thehypoxic group were all significantly increased. Pulmonary vascular structuralremodeling developed after hypoxia. Apoptotic smooth muscle cells of the smalland median pulmonary arteries in the hypoxia group were significantly less thanthose in the control group. After 14 d of hypoxia, Fas expression by smoothmuscle cells of median and small pulmonary arteries was significantly inhibited.L-Arg significantly inhibited hypoxic pulmonary vascular structural remodeling inassociation with an augmentation of apoptosis of smooth muscle cells as well asFas expression in PASMC.

To understand the molecular mechanism by which PPARgamma exertsits effect on glucose-induced insulin secretion, we examined the endogenousactivity of PPAR isoforms, and studied the PPARgamma function and its target geneexpression in INS-1 cells. We found that: (1) endogenous PPARg was activated in aligand-dependent manner in INS-1 cells; (2) overexpression of PPARgamma in theabsence of PPARgamma ligands enhanced glucose-induced insulin secretion, whichindicates that the increased glucose-induced insulin secretion is aPPARgamma-mediated event; (3) the addition of both PPARgamma and retinoid Xreceptor (RXR) ligands showed a synergistic effect on the augmentation ofreporter activity, suggesting that the hetero-dimerization of PPARgamma and RXRis required for the regulation of the target genes; (4) PPARs upregulated boththe glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) and Cb1-associated protein (CAP) genes in INS-1cells.

Retroviralvectors are among the most effective tools for genetic modification of thesecells. However, their transduction efficiency strongly depends on the choice ofthe ex vivo transduction system. The aim of this study was to elaborate a systemfor retroviral vector transduction of human CD34 positive cells isolated fromcord blood. The retroviral vector pMINV EGFP was chosen for transduction of twohuman erythroblastoid cell lines: KG-1a (CD34 positive) and K562 (CD34 negative).For vector construction, three promoters and two retroviral vector packaging celllines were used. To optimize the physicochemical conditions of the transductionprocess, different temperatures of supernatant harvesting, the influence ofcentrifugation and the presence of transduction enhancing agents were tested. Theconditions elaborated with KG-1a cells were further applied for transduction ofCD34 positive cells isolated from cord blood. The optimal efficiency oftransduction of CD34 positive cells with pMINV EGFP retroviral vector (26% ofEGFP positive cells), was obtained using infective vector with LTR retroviralpromoter, produced by TE FLY GA MINV EGFP packaging cell line. The transductionwas performed in the presence of serum, at 37 degrees C, with co-centrifugationof cells with viral supernatants and the use of transduction enhancing agents.This study confirmed that for gene transfer into CD34 positive cells, thedetailed optimization of each element of the transduction process is of greatimportance.",17160143,17160143
7084787977243506621,17160142,Acta biochimica Polonica,Zbrog Z,"The metabolism of oxygen in aerobic organisms leads to generation of reactiveoxygen species (ROS). These entities are able to oxidize almost all classes ofmacromolecules, including proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. The physiologicallevel of ROS is usually regulated by antioxidant defense mechanisms. There are atleast three groups of antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutases, catalases andglutathione peroxidases (GSH-Pxs) which neutralize ROS. The trace elements(copper, zinc and selenium) bound to the active sites of the above listed enzymesplay an important role in the antioxidant defense system. In mammals, a majorfunction of selenium (Se) and Se-dependent GSH-Pxs is to protect cells fromoxidative stress. Selenium concentrations and GSH-Px activities are altered inblood components of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The Se level isfrequently lower than in healthy subjects and the concentration very oftendecreases gradually with advancing stage of the disease. Studies on red cellGSH-Px activity in CKD patients reported its values significantly lower,significantly higher and lower or higher, but not significantly as compared withhealthy subjects. On the other hand, all authors who studied plasma GSH-Pxactivity have shown significantly lower values than in healthy subjects. Thedegree of the reduction decreases gradually with the progression of the disease.High inverse correlations were seen between plasma GSH-Px activity and creatininelevel. A gradual decrease in plasma GSH-Px activity in CKD patients is due to thefact that this enzyme is synthesized predominantly in the kidney and thus theimpairment of this organ is the cause of the enzyme's lower activity. Sesupplementation to CKD patients has a slightly positive effect in the incipientstage of the disease, but usually no effect was observed in end-stage CKD.Presently, kidney transplantation is the only treatment that may restore plasmaSe level and GSH-Px activity in patients suffering from end-stage CKD. A fewstudies have shown that in kidney recipients, plasma Se concentration and GSH-Pxactivity are restored to normal values within a period of 2 weeks to 3 monthsfollowing surgery and thus it can be acknowledged that Se supplementation tothose patients has a positive effect on plasma GSH-Px activity.",17160142,17160142

Inthis paper we studied the expression and hypoxic regulation of PFKFB-4 andPFKFB-3 mRNA as well as its correlation with HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, VEGF andGlut1 mRNA expression in the pancreatic cancer cell line Panc1 and two gastriccancer cell lines MKN45 and NUGC3. This study clearly demonstrated that PFKFB-3and PFKFB-4 mRNA are expresses in MKN45, NUGC3 and Panc1 cancers cells and thatboth genes are responsive to hypoxia in vitro. However, their basal level ofexpression and hypoxia responsiveness vary in the different cells studied.Particularly, PFKFB-3 mRNA is highly expressed in MKN45 and NUGC3 cancer cells,with the highest response to hypoxia in the NUGC3 cell line. The PFKFB-4 mRNA hasa variable low basal level of expression in both gastric and pancreatic cancercell lines. However, the highest hypoxia response of PFKFB-4 mRNA is found in thepancreatic cancer cell line Panc1. The basal level of PFKFB-4 protein expressionis the highest in NUGC3 gastric cancer cell line and lowest in Panc1 cells, withthe highest response to hypoxia in the pancreatic cancer cell line. Furtherstudies showed that PFKFB-3 and PFKFB-4 gene expression was highly responsive tothe hypoxia mimic dimethyloxalylglycine, a specific inhibitor of HIF-alphahydroxylase enzymes, suggesting that the hypoxia responsiveness of PFKFB-3 andPFKFB-4 genes in these cell lines is regulated by the HIF transcription complex.The expression of VEGF and Glut1, which are known HIF-dependent genes, is alsostrongly induced under hypoxic conditions in gastric and pancreatic cancer celllines. The levels of HIF-1alpha protein are increased in both gastric andpancreatic cancer cell lines under hypoxic conditions. However, the basal levelof HIF-1alpha as well as HIF-2alpha mRNA expression and their hypoxiaresponsiveness are different in the MKN45 and NUGC3 cancer cells. Thus, theexpression of HIF-1alpha mRNA is decreased in both gastric cancer cell linestreated by hypoxia or dimethyloxalylglycine, but HIF-2alpha mRNA expression isnot changed significantly in NUGC3 and slightly increased in MKN45 cells.Expression of PFKFB-4 and PFKFB-3 was also studied in gastric cancers andcorresponding nonmalignant tissue counterparts from the same patients on both themRNA and protein levels. The expression of PFKFB-3 and PFKFB-4 mRNA as well asPFKFB-1 and PFKFB-2 mRNA was observed in normal human gastric tissue and wasincreased in malignant gastric tumors. The basal level of PFKFB-4 proteinexpression in gastric cancers was much higher as compared to the PFKFB-3isoenzyme. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that PFKFB-4 and PFKFB-3genes are also expressed in gastric and pancreatic cancer cells, they stronglyrespond to hypoxia via a HIF-1alpha dependent mechanism and, together with theexpression of PFKFB-1 and PFKFB-2 genes, possibly have a significant role in theWarburg effect which is found in malignant cells.",17143338,17143338

Myeloperoxidase, an enzyme which is able to producehypochlorous acid (HOCl), is released from these phagocytic cells, and has beenfound in an active form in atherosclerotic plaques. HOCl can oxidize both thelipid and protein moiety of LDL, and HOCl-modified LDL has been found to bepro-inflammatory, although it is not known which component is responsible forthis effect. As HOCl can oxidize lipids to give chlorohydrins, we hypothesizedthat phospholipid chlorohydrins might have toxic and pro-inflammatory effects. Wehave formed chlorohydrins from fatty acids (oleic, linoleic and arachidonicacids) and from phospholipids (stearoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine,stearoyl-linoleoyl phosphatidylcholine and stearoyl-arachidonoylphosphatidylcholine), and investigated various biological effects of theseoxidation products. Fatty acid and phospholipid chlorohydrins were found todeplete ATP levels in U937 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, withsignificant effects observed at concentrations of 25 microM and above. Lowconcentrations (25 microM) of stearoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine andstearoyl-arachidonoyl phosphatidylcholine chlorohydrins were also found toincrease caspase-3 activity. Finally, stearoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholinechlorohydrin increased leukocyte adhesion to artery segments isolated fromC57Bl/6 mice. These results demonstrate potentially harmful effects of lipidchlorohydrins, and suggest that they may contribute to some of thepro-inflammatory effects that HOCl-modified low density lipoprotein has beenfound to induce.",17128291,17128291

For thefirst time we present the detailed temperature and pH dependence of suchNi(II)-dependent hydrolysis reactions. The temperature dependence of the rate ofhydrolysis yielded activation energy E(a) = 92.0 kJ mol(-1) and activationentropy DeltaS# = 208 J mol(-1) K(-1). The pH profile of the reaction ratecoincided with the formation of the four-nitrogen square-planar Ni(II) complex ofAc-Thr-Glu-Thr-His-His-Lys-NH2. These results expand the range of proteinsequences susceptible to Ni(II) dependent cleavage by those containing threonineresidues and permit predictions of the course of this reaction at varioustemperatures and pH values.",17117212,17117212

Results showed that the fusion protein could significantly increasethe density of B7-1 molecules on WEHI-3 cells, a mouse leukemia cell line.Through allogeneic mixed lymphocyte tumor cultures, it was demonstrated that,with the presence of the first signal, it could also significantly enhance T cellactivation and killing activity against WEHI-3 cells and interleukin-2 secretionby activated mouse T lymphocytes.

We have shown how TRs are alsoable to modify the fate of a cell, thanks to their ability to form complexes withother transcription factors such as p53 - a key regulator of apoptosis andproliferation. Available data show that the function of thyroid hormones and oftheir receptors on cell proliferation is not homogenous. In fact, it stronglydepends on the cell type, its developmental state (progenitor or differentiated),its patho-physiological state (normal or tumor cell), and the so-called 'cellularcontext'.

Treatment ofglioma C6 cells with ROCK inhibitor resulted in actin cytoskeleton reorganizationand also in the changed shape and distribution of mitochondria. Changes in thedistribution of ER, the main calcium store in glioma C6 cells, were not visible.The inhibition of myosin II activity influences the first phase of calciumsignaling evoked by agonist, and both phases of thapsigargin-evoked calciumresponse. We suggest that the observed increase in Ca2+ release fromintracellular stores induced by IP3 formation as well as inhibition of SERCAATPase is at least in part related to severely affected mitochondria. Enhancementof capacitative calcium entry evoked by thapsigargin is probably associated withthe reorganization of the acto-myosin II system. ATP-induced calcium responsepresents no changes in the second phase. We observed that ATP stimulation ofY-27632 pretreated cells leads to immediate morphological rearrangement of gliomaC6 cells. It is a consequence of actin cytoskeleton reorganization: formation ofstress fibers and relocation of phosphorylated myosin II to actin filaments. Itseems that the agonist-evoked strong calcium signal may be sufficient for myosinII activation and the stress fiber organization. This is the first work showingthe dependence between the functional state of the acto-myosin II system andcalcium signaling stressing the reversible character of this relationship.",17115079,17115079

In contrast to oxidized LDL (ox-LDL),high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are able to prevent atherosclerosis through aprotein with antioxidant properties, paraoxonase 1 (PON1). The purpose of thisstudy was to explore the association between the activity of HDL-associated PON1and circulating ox-LDL as well as to investigate the relationship between ox-LDLand parameters of lipid profile in thirty Slovaks aged 21-73 years because recentstudies have presented controversial results concerning PON1 and its role in LDLoxidation. For determination of circulating ox-LDL sandwich ELISA was used andother lipid parameters were determined by routine laboratory analyses. PON1activities were assayed by two synthetic substrates - paraoxon and phenylacetate. Lipid peroxides were determined spectrophotometrically. Of the lipidparameters examined, ox-LDL level correlated positively with total (P < 0.0001)and LDL-cholesterol (P < 0.001). Triacylglycerols (TAG) (P < 0.001), lipidperoxides (P < 0.01) and atherogenic index (AI = total cholesterol/HDL) (P <0.0001) were also strongly correlated with ox-LDL. No inverse relationships wereobserved between ox-LDL and HDL-cholesterol or arylesterase/paraoxonaseactivities of PON1. Furthermore, it was found that ox-LDL (P < 0.01) and lipidperoxides (P < 0.05) were significantly higher in men than in women. PON1arylesterase activity was marginally affected by sex. The results of this studysuggest that the anti-atherogenic properties of HDLs are not directly related totheir total concentration and that PON1 activity determined towards syntheticcompounds (paraoxon and phenyl acetate) reflects no association with markers ofoxidative stress. Furthermore, it follows from our results that men are moresusceptible to developing atherosclerosis compared to women.",17106515,17106515

Using a reportersystem which involves the activation of the cryptic bgl operon in Escherichiacoli, we show that the frequency of IS1 transposition is a function of glucoseconcentration in the growth medium, it is increased by streptomycin amounts thatare below minimum inhibitory concentration (sub-MIC) and is inhibited in anrpsL150 strain with high translation accuracy.

Using porcineplatelets, we tested the hypothesis that ONOO- reduces platelet aggregation anddense granule secretion by inhibiting energy production. It was found that ONOO-(25-300 microM) inhibited collagen-induced dense granule secretion (IC50 = 55 +/-7 microM) more strongly than aggregation (IC(50) = 124 +/- 16 microM). Theantiaggregatory and antisecretory effects of ONOO- were only slightly (5-10%)reduced by 1H-[1,2,4]-oxadiazolo-[4,3-alpha]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), an inhibitorof soluble guanylate cyclase. In resting platelets ONOO- (50-300 microM) enhancedglycolysis rate and reduced oxygen consumption, in a dose dependent manner. TheONOO- effects on glycolysis rate and oxygen consumption were not abolished byODQ. The extent of glycolysis stimulation exerted by ONOO- was similar to thatproduced by respiratory chain inhibitors (cyanide and antimycin A) or anuncoupler (2,4-dinitrophenol). Stimulation of platelets by collagen wasassociated with a rise in mitochondrial oxygen consumption, accelerated lactateproduction, and unchanged intracellular ATP content. In contrast to restingcells, in collagen-stimulated platelets, ONOO- (200 microM) distinctly decreasedthe cellular ATP content. The glycolytic activity and oxygen consumption ofresting platelets were not affected by 8-bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclicmonophosphate. Blocking of the mitochondrial ATP production by antimycin Aslightly reduced collagen-induced aggregation and strongly inhibited densegranule secretion. Treatment of platelets with ONOO- (50-300 microM) resulted indecreased activities of NADH : ubiquinone oxidoreductase, succinate dehydrogenaseand cytochrome oxidase. It is concluded that the inhibitory effect of ONOO- onplatelet secretion and to a lesser extent on aggregation may be mediated, atleast in part, by the reduction of mitochondrial energy production.",17068635,17068635

This paper describesthe cloning and functional characterization of a novel Delta12-fatty aciddesaturase gene from this methylotrophic yeast. The open reading frame of thegene (named Pp-FAD12) is 1263 bp in size and encodes a 420-amino-acid peptide.The deduced Pp-FAD12 protein shows high identity (50-67%) with Delta12-fatty aciddesaturases from other fungi.

As it grew on methanol as a sole carbon source, the strain appearedto be methylotrophic. Furthermore, it was also able to utilize formaldehyde. Amulti-substrate growth potential was shown with several other carbon sources:glucose, glycerol, ethanol as well as petroleum derivatives and phenol. Optimumgrowth temperature was determined at 25 degrees C, and strong inhibition ofgrowth at 37 degrees C together with the original soil habitat indicated lack ofpathogenicity in warm-blooded animals and humans. The unusually high tolerance toxenobiotics such as diesel oil (>30 g/l), methanol (50 g/l), phenol (2 g/l) andformaldehyde (7.5 g/l) proved that the isolate was an extremophilic organism.With high-density cultures, formaldehyde was totally removed at initialconcentrations up to 7.5 g/l within 24 h, which is the highest biodegradationcapability ever reported.

The extract stimulated the activity of phosphatidylinositol(PI) 3-kinase which is a major regulatory molecule in the glucose uptake pathway.About 7-fold increased activity of a PI 3-kinase was observed after treatmentwith G. lucidum extract, whereas PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, blocked the G.lucidum extract-stimulated PI 3-kinase activity in L6 skeletal muscle cells.Protein kinase B, a downstream mediator of PI 3-kinase, was also activated by G.lucidum extract. We then assessed the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase(AMPK), another regulatory molecule in the glucose uptake pathway. G. lucidumextract increased the phosphorylation level of both AMPK alpha1 and alpha2.Activity of p38 MAPK, a downstream mediator of AMPK, was also increased by G.lucidum extract. Taken together, these results suggest that G. lucidum extractmay stimulate glucose uptake, through both PI 3-kinase and AMPK in L6 skeletalmuscle cells thereby contributing to glucose homeostasis.",16964326,16964326

Two functionaldomains have been attributed to MID; MID764-913 functions as an adhesin andpromotes the bacteria to attach to epithelial cells, whereas the IgD-bindingdomain is located within MID962-1200. In parallel, MID is stimulatory for Blymphocytes through the IgD B cell receptor. M. catarrhalis ubiquitous surfaceproteins A1 and A2 (UspA1/A2) are multifunctional outer membrane proteins thatcan bind complement and extracellular matrix proteins such as vitronectin andfibronectin. An interaction between the complement fluid phase regulator of theclassical pathway, C4b binding protein (C4BP), and UspA1/A2 has also beenobserved. Moreover, UspA1/A2 has a unique feature to interfere with the innateimmune system of complement by binding C3.

Theseeffects were monitored at the membrane center as a function of the amount of thecarotenoid added to the sample and as a function of temperature for fluid-phasemembranes. PC membranes with different thickness (from 12 to 22 carbons in alkylchains) were used. Carotenoids shifted to lower temperatures and broadened themain phase transition of PC membranes. They decreased the membrane fluidity andincreased the order of alkyl chains. Carotenoids also increased thehydrophobicity of the membrane interior. These effects were the strongest forlutein, significantly weaker for beta-cryptoxanthin, and negligible forbeta-carotene. They decreased with the increase of the membrane thickness.Presented results suggest that anchoring of carotenoid molecules at the oppositemembrane surfaces by polar hydroxyl groups is significant in enhancing theireffects on membrane properties.

The AD293 cell line is deriveddirectly from the HEK293 cell line but has been transfected with a gene that canimprove cell adherence. We found that there was almost no apoptosis seen in BimL-transfected AD293 cells, but more than half of Bim L-transfected HEK293 cellsunderwent apoptosis. Suppression subtractive hybridization was used to detect thedifferent gene expression profile between these two cell lines. In 192 sequencedpositive clones, there were 30 clones repeating twice or more. Ten genes wereselected for identification by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The transcripts of twoadhesion-related genes (actin and parvin) and two apoptosis-related genes (cyclin2 and protein phosphatase 1G) were up-regulated in AD293 cells. These resultssuggest that the high expression of cell adhesion-related proteins might beresponsible for the different apoptosis status after the transfection of Bim L.Our data provide candidate genes responsible for the different apoptosissensitivity of these two cell lines.

The cytochrome c-catalyzed nitration of tyrosineoccurred in proportion to the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, nitrite orcytochrome c. The cytochromec-catalyzed nitration of tyrosine was inhibited bycatalase, sodium azide, cystein, and uric acid. These results show that thecytochrome c-catalyzed nitrotyrosine formation was due to peroxidase activity.The rate constant between cytochrome c and hydrogen peroxide within the pH rangeof 3-8 was the largest at pH 6 (37 degrees C). The amount of nitrotyrosine formedwas the greatest at pH 5. At pH 3, only cytochromec-independent nitration oftyrosine occurred in the presence of nitrite. At this pH, the UV as well asvisible spectrum of cytochrome c was changed by nitrite, even in the presence ofhydrogen peroxide, probably via the formation of a heme iron-nitric oxidecomplex.

The purpose of this study was to elucidate the propensity of quiescentand proliferating human CD8+ cells to undergo cell death upon treatment withcurcumin, a natural dye in Phase I of clinical trials as a prospectivechemopreventive agent. Methods: We treated human quiescent or proliferating CD8+cells with 50 microM curcumin or irradiated them with UVC. Cell death symptomssuch as decreased cell viability, chromatin condensation, activation of caspase-3and specific DFF40/CAD endonuclease and oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation wereanalyzed using MTT test, microscopic observation, Western blotting and flowcytometry. Results: Curcumin decreased cell viability, activated caspase-3 anddecreased the level of DFF45/ICAD, the inhibitor of the DFF40/CAD endonuclease.However, this did not lead to oligonucleosomal DNA degradation. In contrast,UVC-irradiated proliferating, but not quiescent CD8+ cells revealed molecular andmorphological changes characteristic for apoptosis, including oligonucleosomalDNA fragmentation. Curcumin can induce cell death in normal human lymphocytesboth quiescent and proliferating, without oligonucleosomal DNA degradation whichis considered as a main hallmark of apoptotic cell death.

Many of the mutations in themtDNA affect the expression of the mitochondrial genome. Investigations on cellsfrom patients are not easy, especially as the mitochondrial DNA is heteroplasmicand this state is changed in culture. Moreover, the nuclear background and themitochondrial haplotype may affect the behaviour of cells. Transfer of patientmitochondria to rho zero cell lines is also not optimal as these cells in generalhave many nuclear changes which may also affect cell behaviour. Thus, we decidedto use inhibitors of mitochondrial genome expression, such as thiamphenicol,ethidium bromide and dideoxycytidine to investigate the bioenergetic metabolismof HeLa cells. We found that oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis participateequally in ATP production in HeLa cells and that decreased activity of therespiratory chain leads to increased glycolysis and the reduction of cell growth.Insufficient ATP production in the oxidative phosphorylation process was notcompensated by increased proliferation of the mitochondria. However, we were ableto show that there are some mechanisms compensating limited expression of themitochondrial genome within the mitochondria. Experiments with dideoxycytidinerevealed that 10-fold decrease of the mtDNA copy number resulted in almost normalactivity of cytochrome c oxidase. We found that mtDNA depletion is compensatedmostly on the level of RNA metabolism in the mitochondria. Thus, our results arein agreement with the hypothesis that transcription initiation rather than mtDNAcopy number is a rate limiting factor for expression of the mitochondrial genome.",16951738,16951738

To investigate the specific properties inthe structure-function relationship of the ADA/DPPIV-CD26 complex, its solubleform, identical to large ADA (LADA), was isolated from human blood serum, humanpleural fluid and bovine kidney cortex. The kinetic constants (Km and Vmax) ofLADA and of small ADA (SADA), purified from bovine lung and spleen, were comparedusing adenosine (Ado) and 2'-deoxyadenosine (2'-dAdo) as substrates. TheMichaelis constant, Km, evidences a higher affinity of both substrates (inparticular of more toxic 2'-dAdo) for LADA and proves the modulation of toxicnucleoside neutralization in the extracellular medium due to complex formationbetween ADA and DPPIV-CD26. The values of Vmax are significantly higher for SADA,but the efficiency, Vmax/Km, in LADA-catalyzed 2'-dAdo deamination is higher thanthat in Ado deamination. The interaction of all enzyme preparations withderivatives of adenosine and erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA) wasstudied. 1-DeazaEHNA and 3-deazaEHNA demonstrate stronger inhibiting activitytowards LADA, the DPPIV-CD26-bound form of ADA. The observed differences betweenthe properties of the two ADA isoforms may be considered as a consequence of SADAbinding with DPPIV-CD26. Both SADA and LADA indicated a similar pH-profile ofadenosine deamination reaction with the optimum at pHs 6.5-7.5, while thepH-profile of dipeptidyl peptidase activity of the ADA/DPPIV-CD26 complexappeared in a more alkaline region.",16929383,16929383

The multiparameter regressionanalysis shows that the reactivity of nitroaromatic compounds (n=38) increaseswith an increase in their single-electron reduction potential and the torsionangle between nitrogroup(s) and the aromatic ring. The binding efficiency ofnitroaromatics in the active center of NQO1 exerted a less evident role in theirreactivity. The reduction of nitroaromatics is characterized by more positiveentropies of activation than the reduction of quinones. This points to a lessefficient electronic coupling of nitroaromatics with the reduced isoalloxazinering of FAD, and may explain their lower reactivity as compared to quinones.Another important but poorly understood factor enhancing the reactivity ofnitroaromatics is their ability to bind at the dicumarol/quinone binding site inthe active center of NQO1.",16929382,16929382

Comparative analysis ofTSSR sequence motifs and association between type of motif and its length (n)using rho-coefficient method (quantitatively measuring the association betweenvariables in contingency tables) is presented. These analyses were carried out inthe context of neurodegenerative diseases based on trinucleotide tandems. Thelength of these tandems and their relation to other TSSR is estimated. It wasfound that the higher repetitiveness (n) the lower frequency of trinucleotidestandems. Differences between genomes under consideration, especially in longerthan n=9 TSSR were discussed. A significantly higher frequency off A- and T-richtandems is observed in the human genome (as well as in human mRNA). Thisobservation also applies to mm and rn, although lower abundant in proportion tohuman genomes was found. The origin of elongation (or shortening) of TSSR seemsto be neither frequency nor length dependent. The results of TSSR analysispresented in this work suggest that neurodegenerative disease-relatedmicrosatellites do not differ versus the other except the lower frequency versusthe other TSSR. CAG occurs with relatively high frequency in human mRNA, althoughthere are other TSSR with higher frequency that do not cause comparable diseasedisorders. It suggests that the mechanism of TSSR instability is not the onlyorigin of neurodegenerative diseases.",16733558,16733558

Theuse of neoplasmatic cells to present tumor antigens is one of the approaches incancer vaccines. ALL cells lack the expression of costimulatory molecules and arepoor antigen presenting cells (APCs) for T-cell activation. CD40/40L interactionstimulates B-cells to proliferate, differentiate, upregulate costimulatorymolecules and increase antigen presentation. The aim of the study was to test thehypothesis that ALL cells can be turned into professional APCs by CD40Lactivation. Children with B-cell precursor ALL were enrolled into the study.Mononuclear cells from bone marrow or peripheral blood were stimulated with CD40Land interleukin 4. Results: 1) after culture we noted upregulation of allassessed costimulatory, adhesion and activatory molecules i.e. CD1a, CD11c, CD40,CD54, CD80, CD83, CD86, CD123, HLA class I and II; 2) CD40L activated ALL cellsinduced proliferation of allogeneic T-cells (measured by [(3)H]thymidineincorporation).

TSP-1-dependentactivation of TGFbeta1 axis is known to mediate numerous matrix disorders indiabetes, but its role concerning HA has not been studied so far. In this work wedemonstrated that 30 mM D-glucose increased the incorporation of[(3)H]glucosamine in high-molecular-weight (> 2000 kDa) HA of medium and matrixcompartments of human mesangial cultures. Simultaneously, the synthesis of HAwith lower molecular weight and HA degradation were not altered. The cause of theincreased high-molecular-weight HA synthesis consisted in the up-regulation ofhyaluronan synthase (HAS) 2 mRNA without alterations of the expression of HAS3,which generates HA of lower molecular weight. D-Glucose at 30 mM also stimulatedthe production of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1), the excessiveactivation of which was determined by the up-regulation of thrombospondin-1(TSP-1). The blockage of TGFbeta1 action either by neutralizing anti-TGFbeta1antibodies or by quenching the TGFbeta1 activation (with TSP-1-derived syntheticGGWSHW peptide) abolished the effect of high glucose on HAS2 mRNA expression andnormalized the synthesis of HA. Exogenous human TGFbeta1 had the same effect onHAS2 expression and HA synthesis as high glucose treatment. Therefore, wesupposed that TSP-1-dependent TGFbeta1 activation is involved in the observedhigh glucose effect on HA metabolism. Since high-molecular-weight HA polymers,unlike middle- and low-molecular weight HA oligosaccharides, are known to possessanti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic functions, we suppose that the enrichment ofmesangial matrix with high-molecular-weight HA may represent an endogenousmechanism to limit renal injury in diabetes.",16733556,16733556

Forthat purpose we screened 60 patients with bipolar affective disorder and acontrol group of 66 subjects using single strand conformation polymorphism andsequence analysis. For rapid screening we performed restriction fragment lengthpolymorphism analysis. Screening of bipolar affective disorder patients formutations in TRPM2 led to identification of three novel and four knowntransitions. Two transitions resulted in the substitutions: R755C and A890V.Screening of the coding sequence of ADARB1 did not reveal any mutations exceptone already known transition. A comparison of the transition frequency inpatients and controls does not support association of the detected mutations withbipolar affective disorder. According to our results, bipolar affective disordermay not be caused by mutations in ADARB1.

CAA-induced DNA damage was more extensive in p53 regionswhich revealed secondary structure perturbations, and were localized in regionsof mutation hot-spots. These perturbations inhibited DNA synthesis on undamagedtemplate. We also studied the repair kinetics of CAA-induced DNA lesions in E.coli at nucleotide resolution level. A plasmid bearing full length cDNA of humanp53 gene was modified in vitro with 360 mM CAA and transformed into E. coliDH5alpha strain, in which the adaptive response system had been induced by MMStreatment before the cells were made competent. Following transformation,plasmids were re-isolated from transformed cultures 35, 40, 50 min and 1-24 hafter transformation, and further subjected to LM-PCR, using ANPG, MUG and Fpgglycosylases to identify the sites of DNA damage.

Recent advances in molecular biologyand genome sequencing may lead to a simplistic view that all life processes in acell, or in the whole organism, are strictly and in a linear fashion controlledby genes. In reality, the existing phenotype arises from a complex interaction ofthe genome and various environmental factors. Regulation of gene expression inthe animal organism occurs at the level of epigenetic DNA modification, RNAtranscription, mRNA translation, and many additional alterations of nascentproteins. The process of transcription is highly complicated and includeshundreds of transcription factors, enhancers and silencers, as well as variousspecies of low molecular mass RNAs. In addition, alternative splicing or mRNAediting can generate a family of polypeptides from a single gene. Rearrangementof coding DNA sequences during somatic recombination is the source of greatvariability in the structure of immunoglobulins and some other proteins. Theprocess of rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes, or such phenomena as parentalimprinting of some genes, appear to occur in a random fashion.

The slopeof a semilogarithmic plot of this relation changes at about 1700 pN/s.

Aside fromsuperoxide dismutase, catalase (rarely found in helminths), and glutathioneperoxidase (selenium-independent, thus having a poor activity with H(2)O(2)),peroxiredoxins are probably the major H(2)O(2)-detoxifying enzymes in helminths.Secretion of antioxidant enzymes is stage-specific and there are examples ofregulation of their expression by the concentration of reactive oxygen speciessurrounding the parasite. The majority of parasite-secreted molecules arecommonly found in free-living organisms, thus parasites have only adapted them touse in their way of life.",16410836,16410836
7084787977243506621,16410835,Acta biochimica Polonica,Ciesla J,"Several enzymes that were originally characterized to have one defined functionin intermediatory metabolism are now shown to participate in a number of othercellular processes. Multifunctional proteins may be crucial for building of thehighly complex networks that maintain the function and structure in theeukaryotic cell possessing a relatively low number of protein-encoding genes. Onefacet of this phenomenon, on which I will focus in this review, is theinteraction of metabolic enzymes with RNA. The list of such enzymes known to beassociated with RNA is constantly expanding, but the most intriguing questionremains unanswered: are the metabolic enzyme-RNA interactions relevant in theregulation of cell metabolism? It has been proposed that metabolic RNA-bindingenzymes participate in general regulatory circuits linking a metabolic functionto a regulatory mechanism, similar to the situation of the metabolic enzymeaconitase, which also functions as iron-responsive RNA-binding regulatoryelement. However, some authors have cautioned that some of such enzymes maymerely represent ""molecular fossils"" of the transition from an RNA to a proteinworld and that the RNA-binding properties may not have a functional significance.Here I will describe enzymes that have been shown to interact with RNA (inseveral cases a newly discovered RNA-binding protein has been identified as awell-known metabolic enzyme) and particularly point out those whose ability tointeract with RNA seems to have a proven physiological significance. I will alsotry to depict the molecular switch between an enzyme's metabolic and regulatoryfunctions in cases where such a mechanism has been elucidated. For most of theseenzymes relations between their enzymatic functions and RNA metabolism areunclear or seem not to exist. All these enzymes are ancient, as judged by theirwide distribution, and participate in fundamental biochemical pathways.",16410835,16410835

Thequenching of albumin fluorescence was used to measure the PAH - proteininteraction. The theoretical curve of calculated fluorescence was fitted toexperimental data after necessary corrections regarding PAHs fluorescence andinner filter effect. From the numerical fitting the final association constantswere calculated. Anthracene and anthraquinone failed to quench the albuminfluorescence. 9-anthracenecarboxylic acid showed the highest, while9-anthracenemethanol the weakest albumin binding affinity. The affinity constantsdetermined for 9-anthraldehyde and benzo[a]pyrene were of the same magnitude andindicated low-affinity binding to albumin. The constants obtained for the fourdihydroxyanthraquinones were higher, but dissimilar, which suggests that theposition of the functional group in anthracene molecule influences the bindingconstant. Moreover, this study suggests that the type of substituent plays asignificant role in PAH-albumin complex formation. The carboxylic group increasesthe binding affinity of the anthracene molecule the most rather than the presenceof both carbonyl and hydroxyl groups. The lowest affinity constants were obtainedfor aldehyde, methyl and carbonyl substituents.",16404478,16404478

We studied the efficiency of transfection of human cord blood DC withplasmid DNA carrying the enhanced version of green fluorescent protein (EGFP) asa reporter gene, to test if nonviral gene transfer would be a method to load DCwith protein antigens for immunotherapy purposes. Cord blood mononuclear cellswere cultured in serum-free medium in the presence of granulocyte-monocyte colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF), stem cell factor (SCF) and Flt-3 ligand (FL), togenerate DC from their precursors, and thereafter transfected by electroporation.Maturation of DC was induced by stimulation with GM-CSF, SCF, FL and phorbolmyristate acetate (PMA). Transfected DC strongly expressed EGFP, but transfectionefficiency of DC, defined as HLA-DR(+) cells lacking lineage-specific markers,did not exceed 2.5%. Expression of the reporter gene was also demonstrated in theDC generated from transfected, purified CD34(+) cord blood cells, by stimulationwith GM-CSF, SCF, FL, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Transfectionof CD34(+) cells was very efficient, but proliferation of the transfected cellswas much reduced as compared to the untransfected cells. Therefore, the yield oftransgene-expressing DC was relatively low. In conclusion, nonviral transfectionof cord blood DC proved feasible, but considering the requirements forimmunotherapy in cancer patients, transfection of differentiated DC or generationof DC from transfected hematopoietic stem cells provide only a limited number ofDC expressing the transgene.",16404477,16404477

After study ofeight mitochondrial transcripts (ND1, ND2, ND3, ND5, CO1, CO2, ATP6/8 and Cyt. b)we found a direct correlation between the half-lives of mitochondrial mRNAs andtheir steady-state levels. Investigation of the mt-mRNA decay after thiamphenicoltreatment indicated that three transcripts (ND2, ND3 and Cyt. b) aresignificantly stabilized after inhibition of mitochondrial translation. Carefulanalysis one of them, ND3, showed that inaccurate processing of the H-strand RNAprecursor may occasionally occur between the ND3 and tRNA(Arg) locus leading tosynthesis of ND3 mRNAs lacking the STOP codon. However, analysis of the oligo(A)fraction observed in case of the ND3 indicates that partially polyadenylatedmRNAs are linked rather to the transcription process than to thetranslation-dependent deadenylation. Analysis of ND3 mRNA turnover in cells withsiRNA-mediated knock-down of the mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase shows thatstrongly decreased polyadenylation does not markedly affect the decay of thistranscript.

Unfortunately,it is very difficult to find a peptide system in which conformational transitionscan be studied both experimentally and using MD simulations so that a directcomparison of the results obtained in both ways could be made. Such a system,containing a rigid alpha-helix nucleus stabilized by La(3+) coordination to a12-residue sequence taken from an EF-hand protein has recently been used todetermine experimentally the helix propagation parameters in very shortpolyalanine segments (Goch et al. (2003) Biochemistry 42: 6840-6847). The sameparameters were calculated here for the same peptide system using the peptidegrowth simulation method with, alternatively, charmm 22 and cedar potentialenergy functions. The calculated free energies of the helix-coil transition areabout two times too large for cedar and even three times too large for charmm 22,as compared with the experimental values. We suggest that these discrepancieshave their origin in the incorrect representation of unfolded peptide backbone insolution by the molecular mechanics force fields.",16388314,16388314

It contains conserved and unique sequence elementsthat mediate its function. Two Rab7 genes, Rab7a (703 bp) and Rab7b (707 bp) wereidentified in the unicellular eukaryote Paramecium by PCR amplification. Theycontain three short introns of different lengths (28-32 bp) and sequence locatedat identical positions in both genes. The presence of two Rab7 genes in theParamecium genome was confirmed by Southern hybridization analysis performed withsix different restriction enzymes. Expression of both genes was assessed byNorthern blot and RT-PCR. Two transcripts of 1.8 and 2.2 kb were identified byhybridization analysis. The cloned complementary DNAs, both of 618 nucleotides inlength, encode polypeptides of 206 amino acids that are 97.6% identical anddiffer in their C-termini.

The modelassumes a united-atom and high-coordination lattice representation of thepolypeptide conformational space. The force field of the model mimics theshort-range protein-like conformational stiffness, hydrophobic interactions ofthe side chains and the main-chain hydrogen bonds. Two types of approximationsfor the short-range interactions were compared: simple statistical potentials andknowledge-based protein-specific potentials derived from the sequence-structurecompatibility of short fragments of protein chains. Model proteins in thedenatured state are relatively compact, although the majority of the sampledconformations are globally different from the native fold. At the same time shortprotein fragments are mostly native-like. Thus, the denatured state of the modelproteins has several features of the molten globule state observedexperimentally. Statistical potentials induce native-like conformationalpropensities in the denatured state, especially for the fragments located in thecore of folded proteins. Knowledge-based protein-specific potentials increaseonly slightly the level of similarity to the native conformations, in spite oftheir qualitatively higher specificity in the native structures. For a few cases,where fairly accurate experimental data exist, the simulation results are insemiquantitative agreement with the physical picture revealed by the experiments.This shows that the model studied in this work could be used efficiently incomputational studies of protein dynamics in the denatured state, andconsequently for studies of protein folding pathways, i.e. not only for themodeling of folded structures, as it was shown in previous studies.

In this study, several factors,including differences in alginate composition, the presence or absence ofxenogenic islet tissue and a transient immunosuppression, were investigated in amodel of bovine islet transplantation in rats. A pure alginate with predominantlyguluronic acid (Manugel) and an ultrapure low viscosity guluronic acid alginate(UP-LVG) were used. When microcapsules of Manugel or UP-LVG containing 16,000bovine islet equivalents were transplanted in diabetic rats, we observednormoglycemia for 8.3+/-0.7 (range 6-12 days) and 7.5+/-0.2 days (range 7-8 days)on average, respectively. To ameliorate immunoprotection of alginatemicrocapsules we repeated the same experiments using transient immunosuppressivetherapy. Low doses of cyclosporin A (CyA) administered for 18 days afterimplantation increased the time in normoglycemia, which averaged 27+/-3 days(range 8-55 days) in Manugel capsules while in UP-LVG capsules it averaged 18+/-8days (range 3-39 days). The surface of recovered capsules showed less capsulesfree of overgrowth in Manugel with respect to UP-LVG alginate. These data werecomparable with those observed in empty microcapsules similarly implanted,indicating that the capsular overgrowth was not promoted by the presence ofxenogenic islet tissue. In recovered Manugel capsules the percentage of capsuleswithout fibrotic overgrowth was higher than that observed without CyA. The sameobservation was made in empty capsules.

Fivedifferent SBFs with a composition of 142 Na+, 5 K+, 2.5 Ca2+, 1 Mg2+, 1SO4(2-),1HPO4(2-), and 136 (Cl-+HCO3-) mmol/l were prepared with HCO3- concentrationsranging from 5 to 27 mmol/l. The SBF solutions were prepared by mixing stableconcentrated solutions, which increase the reproducibility of in vitro tests dueto negligible changes of pH during preparation. The high stability of thusprepared SBF enables the evaluation of hydroxyapatite formation on the surface ofbioactive materials without the negative effect of spontaneous precipitation.Furthermore, the use of concentrated solutions offers a facile way to prepare SBFwith different ionic contents and thus modify the composition of Ca-P layersprecipitated on the surface of the bioactive materials exposed to the SBFsolutions. The SBF solutions were shown to be supersaturated with respect toslightly carbonated apatite. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), Raman andX-ray analyses of the precipitated layers indicate that the HCO3- content in SBFinfluences the composition and structure of the calcium phosphates obtained. Itcan be supposed that as long as the HCO3- concentration in the testing solutionsis lower than 20 mmol/l, only B-type HCA precipitates. At higher HCO3-concentrations, it can be assumed that A-type HCA forms as well consideringFT-IR, Raman and X-ray measurements.",16701876,16701876

Composites were prepared by admixture ofeither unmilled or milled zirconia-ACP filler (40% by mass) and photo-activatedresin (60% by mass). One aim was to test if improved ion release can be achievedby elevating the EBPADMA/TEGDMA ratio while lowering the level of surface activemethacryloxyethyl phthalate in the resin without adversely affecting the biaxialflexure strength (BFS), degree of vinyl conversion (DC) and water sorption (WS)of composites. A second aim was to assess the effect of using milled vs. unmilledACP on these properties. Ion release of all composites was significantly abovethe theoretical minimum necessary for remineralization. Calcium ion release wasnot impeded by binding with the carboxylic acid groups of MEP. Increasedsupersaturation was attained with increasing EBPADMA/TEGDMA ratio in the resin.Variations in resin composition had no effect on BFS or DC of composites. The BFSof the milled ACP composites was higher than the BFS of unmilled ACP composites(56% and 79%, respectively for dry and wet specimens). DC of composites was onlymoderately reduced (13.6% and 7.3%, for unmilled and milled ACP, respectively)compared to unfilled resins.

Theporous polymer scaffolds were produced from chitosan by a thermally inducedlyophilisation technique, which yields highly porous, well-controlled anisotropicopen pore architecture. The nucleation of hydroxyapatite crystals was initiatedat ambient conditions on the surface of the polymer scaffold, which was incontact with a calcium solution chamber, due to diffusion of phosphate ionsthrough the scaffold. The morphology of the mineralised scaffold as analysed byscanning electron microscopy shows that apatite crystals were not only formed onthe surface of the scaffold, but also in the pore channels and attached to thepore walls. The X-ray diffraction and Fourier transformed infrared analysesconfirmed the phase purity of the formed apatite crystals.

Transmission electronmicroscopy observation and X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the increaseof Zn content led to smaller crystallites and their specific surface area ofZnHAps increased with increasing Zn content, accordingly. Furthermore, theamounts of BSA adsorption on ZnHAp particles decreased with increasing Zn contentin spite of the increase in the specific surface area.

This paper investigates the scaling effectsof wet adhesion mediated by a liquid bridge between a fiber and a solid surface.The influences of liquid volume and contact angles are discussed via a scalinglaw indicating that the adhesive strength can be enhanced by contact sizereduction. Due to the maximum negative pressure in the liquid bridge, thereexists a critical length scale at which the system achieves the theoreticaltensile strength of the liquid.

When a microdevice comes in contact withany exterior environment, like tissues and/or fluids with a variable pH, thebiomolecules on its surface may get abraded. Silicon based bioMEMS are animportant class of devices. Adhesion, friction and wear properties ofbiomolecules (e.g., proteins) on silicon based surfaces are therefore important.Adhesion was studied between streptavidin and a thermally grown silica substratein a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution with various pH values as afunction of the concentration of biomolecules in the solution. Friction and wearproperties of streptavidin (protein) biomolecules coated on silica by directphysical adsorption and a chemical linker method were studied in PBS using thetapping mode atomic force microscopy at a range of free amplitude voltages.Fluorescence microscopy was used to study the detailed wear mechanism of thebiomolecules. Based on this study, adhesion, friction and wear mechanisms ofbiomolecules on silicon based surfaces are discussed.",16701857,16701857

Another aim was to find out whether thecuring mode affects the quantity of residual monomer and degree of conversion.Glass fibers were preimpregnated with a bioresorbable poly(hydroxyproline) amideand non-resorbable Bis-GMA-TEGDMA resin system. Specimens were immersed in waterfor 1, 3 or 7 days (37 degrees C) to determine the quantity of leached residualmonomers, or in the solvent tetrahydrofuran for 3 days to determine the totalquantity of residual monomers by high performance liquid chromatography. DC% wasmeasured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The quantity of residualmonomer of the specimens decreased when the specimens contained glass fibers,and/or poly(hydroxyproline) amide, and/or when it was post-cured. The majority ofthe residual monomers were leached out during the first 24 h of immersion inwater. The DC% of the specimens increased when post-cured. Also glass fibers inthe composite increased the DC% in contrast to Bis-GMA-TEGDMA resin only. Inconclusion, use of poly(hydroxyproline) amide as a sizing of the glass fibers inFRC does not increase the quantity of residual monomers.

Use of fibrinogenas a primary scaffold component, however, has been limited by traditionalprocessing techniques that render scaffolds with insufficient mechanicalproperties. The goal of this study was to demonstrate, based on mechanicalproperties, that electrospun fibrinogen overcomes these limitations and can besuccessful as a tissue engineering scaffold or wound dressing. Electrospunfibrinogen scaffolds were characterized for fiber diameter and pore area andsubsequently tested for uniaxial mechanical properties while dry and hydrated. Inaddition, uniaxial mechanical testing was conducted on scaffolds treated toregulate scaffold degradation in serum-containing media by supplementing themedia with aprotinin or cross-linking the scaffolds with glutaraldehyde vapor. Alinear relationship between electrospinning solution concentration and measuredfiber diameter was seen; fiber diameters ranged from 120 to 610 nm overelectrospinning concentrations of 80 to 140 mg/ml fibrinogen, respectively. Poreareas ranged from 1.3 microm(2) to 13 microm(2) over the same fibrinogenconcentrations. Aprotinin in the culture media inhibited scaffold degradation ina predictable fashion, but glutaraldehyde vapor fixation produced less reliableresults as evidenced by mechanical property testing.

Observational studies have demonstrated theassociation between life style and prevention of chronic diseases in the generalpopulation. These studies have been showed a reduction of morbidity for vasculardiseases in trained subjects who present adequate cardiovascular fitness andpractise regular exercise. The exercise-related protective effects may bemediated in part through components of the metabolic syndrome: improved insulinsensitivity, decreased weight and visceral fat accumulation, reduced low densitylipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides, increased high density lipoprotein (HDL),decreased blood pressure. These effects are more significant in patients withtype 1 diabetes (T1DM), because hyperglycemia-related morbidity and mortality areassociated with chronic complications. In particular, improved insulinsensitivity may determine a better glucose profile which in turn may positivelyinfluence the diabetes-related microvascular complications. Furthermore, improvedblood pressure and normalization of lipid profile may also contribute to theprevention of vascular complications. Nonetheless, physical activity can improvepsychological well-being by increasing self-esteem and enhancing quality of life.Although patients with T1DM may participate in all kind of sports and physicalactivities, there are several potential adverse events, including hypoglycemicand hyperglycemic episodes, that can occur.

However, there are also intermediate structuresthat do not fit those categories associated with a classical approach tomorphology. To integrate the diversity of forms in the same general framework, weconstructed a theoretical morphospace based on a variety of modalities where itis possible to calculate the morphological distance between plant organs. Thispaper gives emphasis on shoot, leaf, leaflet and trichomes while ignoring theroot. This will allow us to test the hypothesis that classical morphology(typology) and dynamic morphology occupy the same theoretical morphospace and therelationship between the two approaches remains a question of weighting ofcriteria. Our approach considers the shoot (i.e. leafy stem) as the basicmorphological structural unit. A theoretical data table consisting of as manylines as there are possible combinations between different modalities ofcharacters of a typical shoot was generated. By applying a principal componentsanalysis (PCA) to these data it is possible to define a theoretical morphospaceof shoots. Typical morphological elements (shoots, leaves, trichomes) andatypical structures (phylloclades, cladodes) including particular casesrepresenting 'exotic' structures such as the epiphyllous appendages of Begoniaand 'water shoot' and 'leaf' of aquatic Utricularia were placed in themorphospace. The more an organ differs from a typical shoot, the further away itwill be from the barycentre of shoots. By giving a higher weight to variablesused in classical typology, the different organ categories appear to be separate,as expected. If we do not make any particular arbitrary choice in terms ofcharacter weighting, as it is the case in the context of dynamic morphology, theclear separation between organs is replaced by a continuum. Contrary to typicalstructures, ""intermediate"" structures are only compatible with a dynamicmorphology approach whether they are placed in the morphospace based on aponderation compatible with typology or dynamic morphology. The difference inpoints of view between typology and continuum leads to a particular mode ofweighting. By using an equal weighting of characters, contradictions due to theponderation of characters are avoided, and the morphological concepts ofcontinuum' and 'typology' appear as sub-classes of 'process' or 'dynamicmorphology'.",17486414,17486414

One of these processes, the one we dub""range eclipse"", holds that one range expands at the expense of another one,thereby usurping it. Channell and Lomolino (2000a, Journal of Biogeography 27:169-179; 2000b, Nature 403: 84-87; see also Lomolino and Channell, 1995, Journalof Mammalogy 76: 335-347) measured the course of this process in terms of theproportion of the total range remaining in its original centre, therebyessentially assuming a homogeneous distribution of animals over the range.However, part of their measure seems mistaken. By giving a general, analyticalformulation of eclipsing ranges, we estimate the exact course of this process.Also, our formulation does not partition a range into two spatially equal parts,its core and its edge, but it assumes continuity. For applying this model to dataon the time evolution of species, individual time series should be available foreach of them. For practical purposes we give an alternative way of plotting andinterpreting such time series. Our approach, being more sensitive than Channelland Lomolino's, gives a less optimistic indication of range eclipses than theirsonce these have started.",17318329,17318329

NSAIDs, a common treatmentin rheumatoid arthritis, may cause stomach ulcers which call for additionalmedications, notably antacids in the sense of drugs that suppress acid secretionby the stomach. Infection with Helicobacter pylori also plays a role in theulcers. The infection is typically treated with antibiotics added to antacids.Considering NSAIDs and antacids, we suspect that overmedication is common to theextent that particular diets are a better option. Current research and currenttreatments with these drugs are also problematic since circadian rhythms aremostly disregarded.

This stage is also the core of many other proliferative diseases. Thepresent work proposes the first minimal model that combines homeorhesis withoncogenic hyperplasia where the latter is regarded as a genotoxically activatedhomeorhetic dysfunction. This dysfunction is specified as the transitions of thefluid of cells from a fluid, homeorhetic state to a solid, hyperplastic-tumorstate, and back. The key part of the model is a nonlinear reaction-diffusionequation (RDE) where the biochemical-reaction rate is generalized to the one inthe well-known Schlogl physical theory of the non-equilibrium phase transitions.A rigorous analysis of the stability and qualitative aspects of the model, wherepossible, are presented in detail. This is related to the spatially homogeneouscase, i.e. when the above RDE is reduced to a nonlinear ordinary differentialequation. The mentioned genotoxic activation is treated as a prevention of thequiescent G0-stage of the cell cycle implemented with the threshold mechanismthat employs the critical concentration of the cellular fluid and thenonquiescent-cell-duplication time. The continuous tumor morphogeny is describedby a time-space-dependent cellular-fluid concentration. There are no sharpboundaries (i.e. no concentration jumps exist) between the domains of thehomeorhesis- and tumor-cell populations. No presumption on the shape of a tumoris used. To estimate a tumor in specific quantities, the model provides thetime-dependent tumor locus, volume, and boundary that also points out the tumorshape and size. The above features are indispensable in the quantitativedevelopment of antiproliferative drugs or therapies and strategies to preventoncogenic hyperplasia in cancer and other proliferative diseases. The workproposes an analytical-numerical method for solving the aforementioned RDE. A fewtopics for future research are suggested.",16988902,16988902

They were reviewed and assessed at the first visit and every fortnight formeasurement of MARP, pain scores, blood pressure, pulse rate, healing of thefissure and adverse effects. Treatment were continued until healing had occurredor for up to 8 weeks. MARP values before and after application of the GTNointment was 113.2 cm H2O and 72.5 cm H2O respectively (P < 0.001). Nifedipinecaused a reduction in mean MARP from 105.2 to 74.0 cm H2O (P < 0.001). Linearanalogue pain scores were significantly reduced after 2 weeks treatment with GTNand nifedipine (P < 0.001) and continued throughout the treatment period. At theend of the study; 7 of the 10 patients in the GTN group were deemed to be healed(5) or improved (2), compared with 6 of the 10 patients in the nifedipine group(5 healed, 1 improved). Headaches occurred in 3 patients in the GTN group,compared with one patient in the nifedipine group.

7084787977243506621,16612911,Acta chirurgica Belgica,Vanderveken M,"INTRODUCTION: Total mesorectal excision (TME) is the accepted standard for rectalcancer treatment. However, there is an increased risk of symptomatic anastomoticleakage associated with TME as TME potentially endangers the blood supply of theremaining rectum. On top of this, many patients will receive neo-adjuvantradio-chemotherapy. A defunctioning stoma helps in avoiding severe complicationsof anastomotic failure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We prospectively collected data ofall patients with a rectal carcinoma within reach of the palpating finger,operated on in our department between December 2000 and January 2005. There were70 patients (42 men and 28 women, median age 70 (range 32-95)). RESULTS: In 40patients (40/70 = 57%) a sphincter-saving procedure was performed. Elevenpatients were diagnosed with anastomotic leakage or failure. Seven patients hadneo-adjuvant radio-chemotherapy, 4 had no neo-adjuvant therapy. In 4 patientssigns of anastomotic leakage were seen on the barium-enema that is routinelyperformed before closing the defunctioning stoma. Seven patients (7/40 = 17,5%)had clinical signs of anastomotic leakage. Three of them could be treatedconservatively with antibiotics and parenteral nutrition. Two of these patientsdid not have a defunctioning stoma. Four patients needed re-intervention and weretreated in intensive care for several days. Three of these patients did not havea defunctioning stoma. CONCLUSION: Neo-adjuvant radio-chemotherapy and TMEresection are two factors in the treatment of rectal cancer that might interferewith anastomotic healing in the case of a sphincter-saving procedure. Theconstruction of a defunctioning stoma helps in limiting the complications ofanastomotic leakage or failure.",16612911,16612911

Uterine sarcoma is usually diagnosed inpostmenopausal women and the diagnosis is often accidental and postoperative. Aimof this study was to present clinical and pathological characteristics of uterinesarcomas, diagnostic procedures, treatment and two-, three- and five-yearscumulative survival rates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The retrospective study of 61cases of uterine sarcomas was conducted. Cases were distributed into groups basedon definitive diagnosis of uterine sarcoma: group of leiomyosarcomas (LMS),carcinosarcoma (CS), endometrial stromal sarcomas (ESS), adenosarcomas (AS) andother rare uterine sarcomas. We investigated patients with clinical andpathological characteristics of uterine sarcomas, diagnostic procedures andtreatment. Survival rate was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: From 61patients 43 patients (70.49%) were postmenopausal. Mean period from menopauseuntil appearance of symptoms was 14,63 years. One or more risk factors werepresent in 46 (75.4%) patients. Diagnosis of uterine sarcoma were establishedaveragely 7.38 months after appearance of symptoms. 50 patients (82.0%) underwentone or more diagnostic procedures. Preoperative diagnosis of uterine sarcoma wasestablished in 42.5% of patients. 53 (86.9%) of patients were treatedoperatively. The most used operative procedure (60,7%) was total hysterectomywith bilateral salpingooophorectomy. Postoperative pathohistologic analysisshowed that low grade (LG) leiomyosarcoma were present in 19 (35.9%) cases, highgrade (HG) leiomyosarcoma in 1 (1.9%) case, carcinosarcoma in 14 (26.4%) cases,low grade (LG) endometrial stromal sarcoma in 5 (9.4%) cases, high grade (HG)endometrial stromal sarcoma in 9 (17.0%) cases, adenosarcoma in 2 (3.8%) cases,and 2 cases of rare uterine sarcomas: 1 (1.9%) MALT HG lymphoma and 1(1.9%)malignant hemangiopericytoma. In one case of ESS (1.9%) only adenomyosis wasfound postoperatively suggesting that the whole tumour was removed duringdiagnostic procedure. Eight patients were not treated operatively. Two-yearscumulative survival rate was 74.3%, three-years cumulative survival rate was71.1%, and five years survival rate was 64.3%. DISCUSSION: Average age, percentof postmenopausal patients and the mean age at the time of menopause in ourstudied correlate with current data. Clinical presentation of uterine sarcoma isassociated with obesity and hypertension in more than 30% of cases, which isapproved in our study. For early diagnostics it is important to notice that riskfactors are similar to those connected with far more frequent endometrialcarcinoma. Postmenopausal abnormal bleeding was the main reason for medicalexamination, explaining relatively short period for establishing the diagnosis inthis group of patients. The variety of clinical findings in our studied groupshowed that the diagnosis must be based on preoperative pathohistology.CONCLUSION: Adequate diagnosis and treatment of uterine sarcoma is possible withregular yearly or more frequent follow-up, especially in postmenopausal womenwith known risk factors present. We need special attention for unclear symptomsand postmenopausal bleeding and we need to use all diagnostic procedures soon aspossible including preoperative histology because early metastases arecharacteristic for uterine sarcomas.

In this report levels of serum uric acid (UA), a peroxynitrite scavenger,are compared with creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in male patients before and afteropen-heart surgery in order to asses if increased levels of UA may protect heartfrom biochemical damage induced by peroxynitrite during the coronary by-passgrafting (CABG) intervention. METHODS: 45 male patients (16 carvedilol pretreated(6.25 mg/ daily, during 6 weeks before surgery, mean age 55.3+/-1.7 years, range50-71) and 29 patients without carvedilol pretreatment (mean age 58.3+/-1.4years, range 47-73) underwent elective CABG were examined. Study inclusioncriteria were CABG performed on two and more coronary-vessels with aorticcross-clamp during 30-40 minutes. For assessment of patients objective healthstatus before operations EuroSCORE were used. Serum uric acid (UA) levels andcreatine phosphokinase (CPK) were measured spectrophotometricaly by using aquantitative enzymatic assay. RESULTS: Carvedilol pretreated patients had higheramount of serum UA (p<0.05) comparing to non-treated patients. During thesurgical procedure patients are subjected to temporary ischemia due to transferfrom corporeal to extracorporeal circulation. In this period of time the amountof UA decreased in carvedilol pretreated group (406+/-46 (tl) vs. 300+/-22 mmol/L(t2)) to the level of non-treated patients (328+/-14 (t1) vs. 322+18 mmol/L.Carvedilol pretreated patients and non-treated patients had the same level of CPKat the beginning of the surgical procedure (tl) (78+/-6 vs. 83+13 U/L) but lowerincrease (p<0.05) in CPK activity in carvedilol pretreated patients in respect tonon-treated patients (338+46 vs. 644+103 U/L) at the end of procedure (t2). Suchresults suggest that open heart surgery led to elevated CPK levels, but thiseffect was less pronounced in patients with higher level of UA. CONCLUSIONS: Ourresults suggest possible role of UA in the protection from reperfusion injury.Increase of UA before surgery may be beneficial factor during CABG procedure inpatients treated with carvedilol by decreasing level of peroxynitrite as one ofmolecular causes of reperfusion injury. Our results showed influence of UA on CPKlevels at the end of surgical procedure, indicating that increased levels of UAmay protect heart from biochemical damage induced by peroxynitrite during theCABG intervention.",17338197,17338197

Most relapses occur within first two years of follow-up. Depending on thesite of the recurrence, it can be local or distant. It also can be solitary ordiffuse. In terms of potential surgical cure the best results are achieved withsolitary, localized metastases. The most common sites of the solitary metastasesare pelvis, liver and lung, with a fairly even distribution among these threesites. Other sites of the localized metastases can be peritoneum, lymph nodes,brain, bone, abdominal wall, ureter and kidney. These sites are less common, butnot so amenable to resection. Local recurrence varies depending on the originaltype of surgery. It can be stated that surgical technique directly influenceslocal recurrence rate in patients with rectal cancer. According to the resultsfrom a number of different authors 5-year survival rate after reresection is2-13% of all patients with locally recurrent cancer, both alone and associatedwith distant metastases. The most important moment in this problem is to decidewhen not to operate. The absolute contraindications for salvage surgery are:""frozen pelvis"", aneuploid tumors and those with mucinous component, clinical orCT evidence of invasion of the pelvic nerves, lymphatics or veins, or ureterbilaterally. Also, evidence of involvement of the lateral pelvic sidewalls and/orupper sacral marrow, and/or S2 is an absolute contraindication for surgery.

In the USA the annualcost has estimated to be nearly $10 billion. Hip fractures, therefore, representan enormous socio-economic and medical problem and challenge (orthopaedic)surgeons an anaesthetists to find the cheapest and most effective way to treatthem. At the same time the search for preventive measures should be continued.Biphosphonates and hip protectors seem to be able to decrease the risk ofsuffering a hip fracture with 50%. CLASSIFICATION: The first classification offemoral neck fractures, proposed by Abraham Colles, in displaced andnon-displaced (impacted) fractures appears to be still the most useful one. ThePauwels classification cannot be applied to the preoperative x-ray, because thefractured leg is always in external rotation. The Garden classification is notreproducible and does not lead us to the right treatment. TREATMENT: Stabilityand healing chances of impacted fractures depend especially on age and generalcondition. In patients under 70 years of age without co-morbidity, the secondaryinstability rate after non-operative treatment is very low: 5%. In elderly peoplewith multiple co-morbidity secondary instability can go up to 80%. These patientsare better served with primary operative treatment. Although the majority ofsurgeons feel good with a strategy of prophylactic internal fixation in allpatients, this author pleads for non-operative (early mobilization) treatment ofall patients, who are healthy or have only one serious comorbidity. There isconsensus about the treatment of displaced fractures in patients under 65 yearsof age: closed reduction and internal fixation. The best treatment for patientsover 80 years of age is prosthetic replacement. In the (large) group of patientsbetween 65 and 80 years of age calendar age is not a reliable guide to the righttreatment. There is a growing conviction that the choice between internalfixation and prosthetic replacement in these patients should be made on the basisof the biological age (ASA-score, habitat, the activity level, the need forwalking aids and cognitive function). Bone density does not seem to play animportant role. If internal fixation is the preferred treatment, the choice ofimplant is controversial. It is the author's experience that fractures with asteep fracture line (Pauwels 3) should be anatomically reduced and stabilizedwith a sliding hip screw. The less steep fractures (Pauwels 1 and 2) can beslightly over-reduced in valgus and anteversion, which provides a bony supportagainst shearing forces, and fixed with parallel screws according to the3-point-fixation principle. The timing of surgery continues to be a controversialsubject. From a recent study in our own institution we concluded that nosignificant association could be found between delay to surgery and the clinicaloutcomes.However, considering the trends towards less complications and shorterlength of hospital stay, early surgery (within 1 day from admission) is likely tobe beneficial for hip fracture patients who are able to undergo operation. Thereis agreement about the use of the cemented arthroplasty. If a hemiarthroplasty ischosen, the bipolar type is to be preferred to the unipolar type. The differencein price between both prostheses is negligible because the overall cost of thetreatment have gone up so immensely. Furthermore, a basic advantage of thebipolar system is the relatively small operation, needed for conversion to atotal hip replacement, because the stem can stay in place. As to the questionhemiarthroplasty or total hip replacement, the discussion has not yet beenclosed. We studied the natural history of the cemented bipolar hemiarthroplastyby evaluating 307 patients, operated between 1975 and 1989 in our institution.Only 3 patients, who not have been revised, were alive at the end of theobservation period (2004). A striking difference was found in the occurrence oflate mechanical complications (aseptic loosening and acetabular wear) betweenpatients under 75 years of age (22%) and the older group of patients (6%). As tothe patient's overall satisfaction 56% suffered no impairment from theirsustained fracture, 36% were slightly impaired. We concluded that the use of thecemented bipolar prosthesis is justified in patients over 75 years of age.Patients between 65 and 75 years of age should either be treated with internalfixation or with a total hip replacement. NONUNION OF THE FEMORAL NECK: Nowadaysin cases of nonunions of the femoral neck the surgeon is tempted to performprosthetic replacement of the hip, the more so if there is also evidence of adisturbed vascularisation of the head. This will provide rapid pain relief andmobilization. However, long-term results of hip arthroplasties, especially inyounger people and in presence of bone atrophy, are not always as expected and aless radical approach is worth considering. The intertrochanteric valgizationosteotomy, described by Pauwels is an excellent alternative for patients up to 65years of age with a non-union of the femoral neck. A union rate of 80-90% isdescribed by most authors. Leg length, rotational and angular deformities can becorrected at the same time. Between 65 and 80 years a total hip replacement isprobably the best option for fit patients. For elderly patients a cementedbipolar hemiarthroplasty is an adequate treatment.",16613748,16613748

In this area during the first 3 days cells are selected according tothe resistance to the thermal trauma. The basis genetic information of cells isvery resistant, but disorders develop on the genetic expression level.Cells--mainly fibroblasts--which survive the first selection are damaged by thethermal injury to varying degrees and often cause other complications. Duringsynthesis of transcripts of RNA from DNA chains an excessive amount oftranscripts can develop, subjecting the receptor to information about the loss ofskin firmness in defective feedback to the CNS, blocked by fixed trauma emotion.The status is accompanied by swelling, lymphatic stasis, capillary stasis,changes of the local pH and others. During repair facilitated by inflammatoryprocess, excessive amount of collagen is created, as has repeatedly been provedin experiments. The problem can be partially solved by early compression, whichlimits the amount of impulses about insufficient firmness of the skin, andimproves the circulation, while reducing edema, normalizes pH and optimizesproduction of transcripts. RNA polymerase lacks the ability to correct perfectlyand in fact frequently makes mistakes, even under completely normal physiologicalconditions. If the pH is wrong, it can make even more mistakes and producepathological collagen in excessive amounts. RNA is not intended to preserveinformation permanently, and after a certain time it degrades. The onset of thisdegradation is determined by the cell as well as the amount of created proteins.If RNA is not degraded on time, overproduction of protein and collagen is anatural consequence of the developed defect. Messenger RNA (mRNA) directs thecreation of proteins. In case that it is not properly cut in the cellularnucleus, qualitative and quantitative errors in transcription into the proteindevelop. The non-information RNA takes an enzyme part and plays a role during thetransfer of RNA into the protein. It does not have the correction ability.Transfer tRNA chooses appropriately amino acids and places them into the growingprotein chain. At the same time, it can make errors and interchange amino acids.",17294912,17294912

The incidence ofspecific cleft types in a population and their relative numbers show specificdifferences between ethnic groups and races. However, there are no available dataabout the incidence and relative numbers of orofacial cleft types (CL, CLP, CP)in the gypsy ethnic group. The aim of this study was to compare relative numbersof specific types of orofacial clefts between the Czech gypsy and non-gypsypopulations. We conducted a retrospective epidemiological study using a set ofall living patients with orofacial clefts born in the Czech Republic from 1964until 2002. The cleft patients were subdivided into three groups: 5304 non-gypsychildren, both parents of whom were non-gypsies (NN), 98 gypsy children, bothparents of whom were gypsies (GG) and 18 children with one parent non-gypsy andone parent gypsy (NG). The relative number of isolated CP was 37.1% in NNchildren. However, the relative number of CP was significantly reduced to 5.1% (P< 0.01) in the GG group. Conversely, the relative number of CLP was higher (P <0.01) in the GG group (62.2%) in comparison to the NN group (39.2%). The tendencyto decrease in the relative number of CP and increase in the relative number ofCLP was also apparent in the NG group, but not so well expressed. We hypothesizethat the decrease in CP and increase in CLP and CL in gypsies might be caused bytheir genetic predis-position to CL.

Hence, the different reconstructive techniques in particular and therate of recurrence are evaluated in this study. PATIENTS: 205 patients receivingresections of basal cell carcinomas and facial skin reconstructions were includedand data were analyzed. RESULTS: The rate of recurrence was 7.3% after follow-upat an average of 2.5 years (0.5-5 years). Local flaps, full-thickness skin graftsand skin extension closures were carried out most often; indications forsplit-thickness skin grafts were rare. Sensitivity disturbances occurred in only3.6% of skin extension closures and in 11.7% of local flaps, but in 22.7% offull-thickness skin grafts and in 38.7% of split-thickness skin grafts. Theaesthetic outcomes were evaluated through clinical inspection and by usingpatients' scale.

The fundamental document relevant toallogeneic transplants, establishing the minimal level of safety guaranteed inEuropean Union states, is the European Parliament and Council Directive(2004/23/EC) from March 31st 2004. This Directive determines that grafts will beprepared by a licensed or accredited tissue bank, and that this arrangement mustbe put in place by the member states within 2 years. In the Czech Republiclicensing of tissue banks took place immediately after issuance of the Directive.Licensing was also a condition for product reimbursement by insurance companies.To gain a licence, tissue banks had to fulfil many safety criteria associatedwith screening of living or deceased donors for health suitability, providingtraceability of the donor-recipient route, prevention of secondary andcross-contamination during processing and storage of the harvested tissues, proofof product microbiology check up, and cold chain control. The Tissue Bank of theFaculty Hospital in Hradec Kralove is one of the two tissue banks that gained thebroader type of 'multifunctional' licence and was granted registration number MTB006. Obtaining the licence was facilitated by completion of a new workplaceproject conceived as a combination of cryogenic and clean-room technology.Currently, this tissue bank prepares cryopreserved dermoepidermal and dermalgrafts as well as amnion and chorioamnion grafts. All tissue banks will have torenew their licences again according to the conditions established by a new lawabout human tissues and cells which is currently in preparation. Neither theDirective of the European Parliament nor the Transplantation Law of the CzechRepublic regulates the issue of xenografts. Since availability of allogeneicbiological covers is limited, it is significant that the WHO perspective on theuse of xenogeneic biological covers, as established in 2005, is positive. Thisattitude should also be taken in the Czech Republic. The directives of theEuropean Union pertinent to medical devices of biological origins can be appliedonly to devitalized tissues--and moreover, the domestic pig is not on the riskanimal list.

The aims of this work was to study possible anti-inflammatoryeffects of simvastatin in abdominal sepsis. Serum pro-inflammatory cytokines andleukocytes count were determined in an experimental model of abdominal sepsis,using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in rats. METHODS: Twenty eight Wistarrats weighing 285+/-12 g were randomly divided in: CLP/Sinvastatin rats (n=7),treated with 10 mg/Kg of oral simvastatin 18 and 2 hs before CLP; CLP/Salinegroup rats (n=7), treated with oral saline; group Sham/Simvastatin (n=7), treatedwith simvastatin, and group Sham/Saline (n=7), treated with saline. SerumTNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 by ELISA and total leukocytes, neutrophils,lymphocytes, and eosinophils were determined 24 hs after CLP. ANOVA and Tukeytest were used considering significant p<0.05. RESULTS: It was demonstrated thatserum TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 were respectively 364.8+/-42 pg/mL; 46.3+/-18pg/mL and 28.4+/-13 pg/mL in CLP/Sinvastatin rats, significantly lower (p<0.05)than in group CLP/Saline (778.5+/-86 pg/ml; 176.9+/-46 pg/ml; 133.6+/-21 pg/ml,respectively). The same results were observed in total leukocytes and neutrophilscounts. CONCLUSION: These results clearly demonstrate that simvastatin is aneffective agent that reduces cytokines levels and leukocyte count in sepsis,independently of its well-known lipid-lowering effects.

On account of thecomplexity of mechanisms related to pathophysiology of ischemia and reperfusion(I/R) injury, this review deals with I/R effects on sinusoidal microcirculation,especially when steatosis is present. Alterations in hepatic microcirculation arepointed as a main factor to explain lower tolerance of fatty liver toischemia-reperfusion insult. The employment of therapeutic strategies thatinterfere directly with vasoactive mediators (nitric oxide and endothelins)acting on the sinusoidal perfusion seem to be determinant for the protection ofthe liver parenchyma against I/R.

The partial hepatectomy (HP) was performed in all animalsthrough exeresis of approximately 90% of the liver parenchyma. The animals fromgroups HP and Laser application, HPL24, HPL48 and HPL72 undertook laserirradiation carried out through application (dose of 22.5 J/cm2) in fivedifferent sites in the reminiscent liver. The rats were then sacrificed 24, 48and 72 hours after HP procedure, for the liver regeneration analysis,using theProliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA),and for dosage of serumaminotransferases. RESULTS: Were demonstrated an increase of the serum levels ofalanine aminotransferase for the group of 24 hours and a decrease for the groupof 72 hours exposed to laser. The index of marked cells had a considerable moreimprovement for the group of 72 hours exposed in laser compared to other groups.CONCLUSION: Laser did not cause hepatic injuries additional to the partialhepatectomy and perhaps led to a benefit by stimulating the proliferativeactivity.",17013509,17013509

METHODS: Cirrhosis was induced inWistar rats by occlusion of the hepatic duct. The animals were divided into fourgroups of six animals each: non-cirrhotic group (simulated operation only),cirrhotic control group (simulated operation in cirrhotic rats), I/R group(40-minute ischemia without IPC), and IPC group (cirrhotic rats with ischemia,previously submitted to IPC). The IPC procedure consisted of partial hepaticischemia for five minutes, followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion. In the case ofthe IPC group, the animals were submitted to liver ischemia for 40 minutes afterthe preconditioning procedure, followed by 2 hours of reperfusion. Blood sampleswere collected for measurement of serum aminotransferases (ALT and AST). Therespiratory control ratio (RCR), the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), andmalondialdehyde (MDA) values in the hepatic tissue were analyzed. Nonparametricstatistical analysis was used and a value of p<0.05 was considered statisticallysignificant. RESULTS: Ischemia did not induce significant increase in ALT and ASTlevels. MDA values were significantly higher in cirrhotic animals. MMP did notsignificantly change in cirrhosis and liver ischemia. Mitochondrial RCR decreasedin liver cirrhosis, accentuated upon liver ischemia, and did not significantlychange with IPC.

METHODS: Used 18rats Wistar, males, adult, divided into three groups as the solution used toreanimation: Group PSS: physiologic saline solution; Group HSS: hypertonic salinehypertonic (7.5%) followed by lactated ringer's solution; Group LRS: lactatedringer's solution. All the animals were submitted to the bleeding controlleduntil mean arterial pressure (MAP) 40 mmHg, for 20 minutes. Performed volemicreplacement until PAM=80 mmHg with the solution according the studied group,followed by laparotomy and Pringle's Maneuver for 15 minutes. The animals wereaccompanied until for two hours. To statistical comparisons between mean ofneutrophils sequestration, in interstitium of the renal cortex, were made thetests One-way ANOVA and covariance analysis, adjusting itself for time ofsupervened. The hemodynamic parameters evaluated were: MAP, heat rate, cardiacindex, vascular resistance system index. The analyzed metabolic variables were:pH, bicarbonate, base deficit and lactato, besides electrolytes. RESULTS: Themean values of supervened, in minutes, for group were: Group PSS 79.0+/-12.0;Group LRS 97.0+/-11.0; Group HSS 67.0+/-10.

Mistaken injections of gas in the preperitoneal space are notrare. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the correct positioning of thetip of the needle during creation of pneumoperitoneum. METHODS: The needle wasinserted into the peritoneal cavity. Tests to assess the positioning of theneedle tip were carried out. Pressure, flow rate and volume were periodicallyrecorded and the needle was removed, being immediately reinserted into the righthypochondrium and placed in the preperitoneal space. RESULTS: The liquid flowtest was always positive in the peritoneal cavity. No resistance to salineinjection into the peritoneal cavity was observed, but increased resistance tosaline injection into the preperitoneal space was observed in 45.5% of the cases.Some saline was recovered in 63.5% of the cases in the peritoneal cavity, and in54.5% in the preperitoneal space. Saline drop test was positive in 66.6% of thecases in the peritoneal cavity and in 45.5% in the preperitoneal space. In theperitoneal cavity, initial pressure lower than 5 mm Hg was observed, and thispressure gradually increased during 123 seconds until reaching 15 mm Hg. In thepreperitoneal space, initial pressure was 15 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: Aspiration,liquid flow and saline drop tests are important, whereas recovery test isinconclusive. Initial pressure of approximately 5 mm Hg indicates that the tip ofthe needle is in the peritoneal cavity. The peritoneal cavity should hold tentimes as much volume of gas as the preperitoneal space.

Here, five new crystal structures of this enzyme aredescribed that provide several insights. Firstly, the structure of a complex ofthe wild-type human enzyme with glutathione was determined for the first time at2.0 angstroms resolution. This reveals that glutathione binds in the G site in avery similar fashion as the glutathione portion of substrate analogues in otherstructures and also that glutathione binding alone is sufficient to stabilize theC-terminal helix of the protein. Secondly, we have studied the complex with adecarboxylated glutathione conjugate that is known to dramatically decrease theactivity of the enzyme. The T68E mutant of human glutathione transferase A1-1recovers some of the activity that is lost with the decarboxylated glutathione,but our structures of this mutant show that none of the earlier explanations ofthis phenomenon are likely to be correct. Thirdly, and serendipitously, the apostructures also reveal the conformation of the crucial C-terminal region that isdisordered in all previous apo structures. The C-terminal region can adopt anordered helix-like structure even in the apo state, but shows a strong tendencyto unwind.

Careful consideration of all identified twins showed that in manycases twinning was ignored during structure solution and refinement. Manualanalysis of the models showed that twinning often occurs in association withrotational pseudosymmetry parallel to the twinning operator. The coexistence ofthese two phenomena complicates the detection and diagnostics of twinning usingcurrently available twinning tests. It was concluded that a twinning-detectionstep should be incorporated in every stage of structure analysis from dataacquisition to refinement and validation.,16369097,16369097

The cytomorphologic features in intraoperativeimprint smears from 2 cases of desmoplastic medulloblastoma are described. CASEREPORTS: A 22-year-old man and 27-year-old woman with a cerebellar tumorunderwent craniotomy and tumor resection. The imprint cytologic smears containedcellular zones and nodular hypocellular areas containing astroglial andoligodendrogliallike elements. The cytology was misinterpreted as glial tumors,while the final histologic diagnosis in both cases were desmoplasticmedulloblastoma. CONCLUSION: Desmoplastic medulloblastoma shows distinctivecytology in intraoperative smears. However, the occurrence of this rare type inadults and the presence of astroglial elements in imprint smears may cause acytologic misinterpretation as gliomas.",16514849,16514849

Among the varioustypes of carcinomas that can be seen histologically in a CEPA, myoepithelialcarcinoma is one of the rarest forms. CASE: A 76-year-old woman presented with anincidental parotid/parapharyngeal mass. Computed tomography-guide fine needleaspiration (FNA) showed a biphasic neoplasm with epithelial and stromalcomponents consistent with pleomorphic adenoma (PA). However, in addition, adistinct population of discohesive atypical and pleomorphic cells with highnuclear/cytoplasmic ratio was noted in the background. In the cytopathologicdiagnosis a suspicion was raised about a possible CEPA. Subsequent resection ofthe parotid mass confirmed the presence of low grade myoepithelial carcinomaarising in a PA. CONCLUSION: Although uncommon, CEPA should be suspected on FNAwhen atypical cytomorphologic characteristics are observed. In rare cases amyoepithelial carcinoma also arises in a preexisting PA, necessitating anaccurate interpretation for more definitive therapy.",16514848,16514848
7084787977243506621,16514847,Acta cytologica,Baehner FL,"BACKGROUND: Adult perineal soft tissue sarcomas are rare. Fewer than 30 caseshave been reported, and all were diagnosed after surgical resection by histologicexamination. Below we report a case in which the diagnosis was establishedpreoperatively by fine needle aspiration (FNA). CASE: A 27-year-old man presentedwith a firm, midline, perineal mass. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 3-cm,enhancing mass that was considered neoplastic. FNA biopsy, followed by cytologicexamination, revealed moderately cellular aspirates composed of discohesive,small, blue cells with scant cytoplasm, high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios andpleomorphic nuclei with irregular nuclear contours; uniform, hyperchromaticchromatin; and occasional mitotic figures. Frequent naked nuclei and scatteredcells with more abundant, dense cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei were also noted.The diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma was favored on FNA and was corroborated byimmunohistochemical stains for desmin, myogenin and CD56. Upon surgicalresection, the diagnosis of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma was confirmedhistologically and immunophenotypically. CONCLUSION: FNA is a useful tool indiagnosing soft tissue lessions of the perineum, including rare primary tumors,such as adult rhabdomyosarcoma. In this case, early identification avoidedincisional biopsy and directed appropriate extirpative surgery and reconstructionconsiderations.",16514847,16514847
7084787977243506621,16514846,Acta cytologica,Maly B,"BACKGROUND: Neuroendocrine tumor metastatic to the thyroid gland is rare and maybe difficult to differentiate from primary thyroid neuroendocrine tumors, such asmedullary thyroid carcinoma (M/ITC). This report describes an unusual case ofbronchial carcinoid metastatic to the thyroid diagnosed by fine needle aspirationcytology (FNAC). CASE: A 42-year-old woman with an undiagnosed bronchialcarcinoid tumor presented to our clinic with a solitary nodule in the thyroidgland. FNAC of the nodule showed loosely cohesive groups of cuboidal tumor cellswith scant, slightly granular cytoplasm; centrally located nuclei with a coarselygranular, salt-and-pepper chromatin pattern and inconspicuous nucleoli.Immunocytochemically the tumor cells were positive for neuron-specific enolase,chromogranin and synaptophysin and negative for thyroglobulin, calcitonin andcarcinoembryonic antigen. The cytologic diagnosis of a metastatic neuroendocrinecarcinoma was confirmed histologically. CONCLUSION: Metastasis to the thyroidgland may pose a diagnostic problem, particularly with tumors of neuroendocrineorigin, as these have similar cytologic features in various organs. The correctpreoperative cytologic diagnosis of metastatic carcinoid tumor in patientswithout a prior history of cancer and differential diagnosis with MTC are crucialbecause prognosis, workup and treatment are different in each.",16514846,16514846

The tumor has occurred rarely at many sites, such as thyroid,pancreas, soft tissue, breast, skin, heart, colon, lung, kidney, ovary andbladder. The exact origin of the tumor is unclear. However, osteoclastlike giantcells have been considered either part of a stromal process reactive to aneoplasm or a component of a primary neoplasm. CASE: A 35-year-old femalepresented with a mass in the left parotid gland clinically diagnosed as apleomorphic adenoma. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) was advised before surgicalexcision. FNA smears revealed numerous osteoclastlike, multinucleated giant cellsand many malignant-looking mononuclear cells. The smears were diagnosed aspositive for malignancy, suggestive of osteoclastomalike giant cell tumor. Thetumor was excised, and histopathologic study confirmed the cytologic diagnosis.CONCLUSION: The cytologic findings of osteoclastomalike giant cell tumor of theparotid gland have not been previously reported. FNA aided the diagnosis andplanning of treatment. FNA is important in the diagnosis of parotid tumors.",16514845,16514845

STUDY DESIGN:Five cases of gastric xanthoma that were confirmed by biopsy reports wereselected for study. The patients' ages ranged between 50 and 58 years; 4 were menand 1 was a woman. Twenty-one cases of signet-ring adenocarcinoma confirmed bybiopsy reports were selected for comparison. Special staining was performed.RESULTS: The brushing cytology smears of the 5 cases of xanthoma revealedatypical cells, so initially they were reported as suspicious for signet-ringadenocarcinoma and biopsy examination advised. After learning of the histologicdiagnosis of xanthoma, we performed special staining. The xanthoma cells werenegative with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain but showed a positive reactionwith Oil red 0 and weakly positive reaction with Masson trichrome. Signet-ringadenocarcinoma cells showed a strongly positive reaction with PAS stain.CONCLUSION: Gastric brushing cytology findings of xanthomas have not beendescribed before.

STUDY DESIGN: Urinespecimens from 469 cases of suspected or proven bladder cancer received over aperiod of 5 years were analyzed in the cytology laboratory. In 35 cases, totalbladder resection was followed by ileal conduit reconstruction. The follow-upcytologic analysis of these 35 ileal conduit cases formed the basis of thisstudy. RESULTS: There was absence of urothelial cells in all but 2 cases. Thesmear predominantly showed small, scattered intestinal mucosal cells withpyknotic nuclei, extensive karyorrhexis and numerous bacteria. In 2 cases,cytology proved superior to endoscopy and radiology in detecting recurrentdisease. We had 2 false negative cases, and the negativity was attributed tosampling errors. There was 1 false positive case in which 3-dimensional clustersof intestinal columnar cells were erroneously diagnosed as adenocarcinoma.CONCLUSION: Urine obtained from ileal conduit specimens shows a smear picturethat is different from that of specimens from the bladder. Thus, it is imperativeto understand the difference between the cytomorphology of bladder urine andileal conduit urine, to minimize the pitfalls and increase diagnostic utility.",16514843,16514843

STUDY DESIGN: Three hundred one endometrialsamplings were obtained, using the Endogyn endometrial device (Biogyn S. n.c.,Italy), from perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. The endometrial samplingswere collected in a vial with liquid fixative for the TP processing. One TP slidewas prepared from each case. If adequate material remained in the vial after theTP slide preparation, it was processed for IFS-CB preparation. RESULTS: IFS-CBpreparation was processed in 263 cases (87%) with adequate material. Diagnoses onIFS-CB preparations obtained by endometrial sampling matched those of thehysterectomy specimens. The addition of IFS-CB histology to the cytologicdiagnosis by TP increased the diagnostic accuracy of endometrial cytology to96.3% and 100% for benign/atrophic endometrium and adenocarcinoma, respectively(p = 0.39 and 0.46). In hyperplasia without atypia and hyperplasia with atypia,the diagnostic accuracy increased significantly, to 96% and 95.3%, respectively(p = 0.037 and < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the merit of linkingTP cytology with direct endometrial sampling, including small tissue fragmentsand material adequate for IFS-CB preparation.

STUDYDESIGN: One hundred Pap smears from 100 women were prospectively procured aftergynecologic Pap smears were collected for the ThinPrep Pap test. The sampling endof the collection devices was cut off and placed in a vial that containedSUREPATH preservative fluid (TriPath Imaging, Inc., Burlington, North Carolina,U.S.A). The residual cell samples were processed using the SurePath PREPSTAINslide processor (TriPath). A single liquid-based slide was prepared from thesampling devices from each of the 100 specimens collected. The slides producedfrom the discarded devices were reviewed for the following: squamous cells,endocervical component, epithelial cell abnormalities and miscellaneous findings.The slides prepared from the ""throw-away"" (TA) material were subsequentlycompared with the primary ThinPrep Pap smear slide. RESULTS: Twenty-five percentof the TA samples had an equal or greater number of squamous cells per high-powermicroscopic field when compared to the primary ThinPrep slide, with 8% of the TAslides demonstrating greater overall cellularity. An endocervical component waspresent on 27 of 66 cervical samples (40.9%). Three of five cases (60%)interpreted as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance had similarcells on the TA slides. Two cases of atypical glandular cells of undeterminedsignificance had no abnormal cells on the TA slides. Twelve of 14 cases (85.71%)of low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion contained similar cells on the TAslides. Two of four cases (50%) of high grade squamous intraepithelial lesionalso had similar abnormal cells on the TA slides. Miscellaneous findings included1 case of benign endometrial cells and 4 Candida infections present on bothpreparations, along with 1 case of Trichomonas vaginalis organisms present on theThinPrep slide only. In 1 specimen, several multinucleated histiocytic giantcells were present only on the TA slide. CONCLUSIONS: Specimens prepared from TAcollecting devices used for the ThinPrep Pap test are less sensitive than theprimary specimen for the detection of cervical lesions. This is in contrast tosplit-sample studies involving ThinPrep and conventional smears. Our studydocumented the presence of normal and abnormal cells discarded from ThinPrepsampling devices in a high percentage of cases. Discarded abnormal cells on theTA slides were, however, few when compared to the primary specimen, with only 1exception involving a high grade lesion.",16514841,16514841

STUDYDESIGN: A retrospective search identified 90 cervicovaginal smears (vaginal pool)with a diagnosis of AGC-EM, in 2 tertiary care medical centers between January1998 and December 2002. RESULTS: Forty-six (51%) were conventional preparationsand 44 (49%) were liquid-based monolayers (SurePath, TriPath Imaging Inc.,Burlington, North Carolina, U.S.A.). Follow-up biopsies were available in 55 of90 (61%) cases, 15 of 90 (17%) cases had cytology follow-up, and 20 of 90 (22%)were lost to follow-up. The patients ranged in age from 30 to 86 years (mean,56); 56 of 90 (62%) were > 50 years. Among the patients who underwent biopsy, 22(40%) had a clinically significant lesion, including 10 (18%) endometrialadenocarcinomas, 8 (15%) endometrial hyperplasias and 4 (7%) high grade squamousintraepithelial lesion/squamous cell carcinoma, nonkeratinizing type. Theremaining 33 patients had benign histology, including benign endometrium,endometrial polyp, tubal metaplasia, cystic endometrial atrophy and cervicalmicroglandular hyperplasia. Of the patients with cytologic follow-up, 2 had Papsmears showing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, while theremainder had negative results. CONCLUSION: In our study population, 40% (22 of55) of women who underwent biopsy following a diagnosis of AGC-EM had significantuterine lesions, with the majority of the lesions endometrial in origin. Patientswith a diagnosis of AGC-EM, especially those > 50, should be followed closely,and endometrial sampling should be included in their initial workup.",16514840,16514840

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey of patients andphysicians in the UAE with regard to cervical cytology was carried out.Knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of a group of female primary carephysicians on cervical cytology were assessed by a self-administeredquestionnaire. Pap smears and Chlamydia testing were offered to women attendingselected primary care centers and secondary health care facilities. RESULTS:Results of Chlamydia prevalence and KAP were published elsewhere; this reportaddresses the cytologic aspects of this study. There were 2,013 smears collectedfrom primary health centers and 2,042 from secondary care. The overall rate ofcervical screening among women in this survey was 85.5% in primary care and 77%in secondary care. The proportion of unsatisfactory smears was < 5%. Theprevalence of cervical abnormalities according to the Bethesda System 2001 was3.6%. There were 9 (primary care) and 21 (secondary care) cases of low gradesquamous intraepithelial lesion (LSILs), for a prevalence of 0.77%. There were 4primary care and 17 secondary care cases of high grade squamous intraepitheliallesion (HSIL), for a prevalence of 0.54%. The combined prevalence for LSIL andHSIL is 1.32%. There were 3 cases of glandular abnormalities. The atypicalsquamous cells of undetermined significance/SIL ratio was 1.71. No cases ofsquamous cell carcinoma were detected. No tissue follow-up information isavailable. The prevalence of cervical abnormalities is low in the UAE.

STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed the clinical and cytologic features in29 cases of intraductal papilloma and 26 cases of atypical papilloma or papillarycarcinoma that had been diagnosed by histologic examination. The diameter of themass was examined as a clinical feature. The cytologic features evaluated were asfollows: bloody background, row of tall columnar cells, naked bipolar nuclei,hemosiderin-laden macrophages, myoepithelial cells, single scattered atypicalcells, cellularity, nuclear atypia, nuclear grade, apocrine metaplasia,eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules, papillary clusters, small papillae, cell ballsand large sheets. RESULTS: Of the features evaluated, the diameter of the mass,naked bipolar nuclei and cell balls differed significantly between benign andatypical or malignant papillary neoplasms. The average diameter of a benignpapillary neoplasm was 1.8 cm, and that of an atypical or malignant papillaryneoplasm was 2.2 cm (p = 0.042). Naked bipolar nuclei were found in 27 cases ofbenign papillary neoplasm (93.1%) versus 19 cases of atypical or malignantpapillary neoplasm (73.1%) (p = 0.050). Cell balls were found in 14 (48.3%) and21 (80.8%) cases, respectively (p = 0.012). All 6 cases in which cell balls werepresent and naked bipolar nuclei were absent proved to be atypical or malignantpapillary neoplasms. Of 17 cases in which cell balls were absent and nakedbipolar nuclei present, 13 (76.5%) were benign papillary neoplasms. CONCLUSION:Most cytologic features overlapped in benign and atypical or malignant papillaryneoplasms. Although they were not pathognomonic, naked bipolar nuclei and cellballs were cytologic features that differed significantly between benign andatypical or malignant papillary neoplasms. When papillary neoplasms of the breastare suspected in a cytologic smear, the combination of clinical examination,mammography and cytologic features should be considered to make the correctdiagnosis.",16514838,16514838

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 146follicular lesions diagnosed cytologically, obtained from patients who hadundergone thyroidectomy for either benign or malignant nodules, were evaluatedusing Papanicolaou-stained slides and cell blocks with galectin-3 immunostaining.We primarily categorized the aspirated specimens as benign, indeterminate orsuspicious for a follicular neoplasm based on cellularity, architecturalarrangement of the follicular cells and presence or absence of colloid.Galectin-3 immunostaining was evaluated according to the proportion and intensityof positively stained cells. Cytologic diagnoses were correlated with the resultsof galectin-3 and categorized into 3 groups (benign, indeterminate formalignancy, suspicious for malignancy) and compared with the correspondinghistologic diagnoses. RESULTS: When the histologic diagnoses were compared withthe cytologic diagnoses, the accuracy in the distinction between benign andmalignant cases was 79.5% except for 8 cytologically and 3 histologicallyindeterminate cases. Except for 11 indeterminate cases, there were 18 (12.3%)discrepant cases. False positive cases included 8 of 62 (12.9%) nodularhyperplasias and 1 of 42 (2.4%) follicular adenomas. Of 9 false negative cases, 4minimally invasive carcinomas and 2 widely invasive carcinomas were included.Three follicular tumors of uncertain malignant potential were cytologicallycategorized as malignant, and all cases showed positivity for galectin-3.CONCLUSION: Galectin-3 could be used as a useful supplementary marker forcytologic diagnosis, although it was not an absolute marker in determiningwhether a lesion was benign or malignant.",16514837,16514837

STUDY DESIGN: This study included 459 thyroid FNAspecimens obtained from patients who came to our endocrinology department withvarious thyroid disorders over 3 years. The cytologic material was prepared usingboth the conventional and ThinPrep method in the first 2 years (285 cases), whilein the last one only the ThinPrep method was used (1 74 cases). The smears werestained using a modified Papanicolaou procedure and May-Grunwald-Giemsa stain.Immunocytochemistry was performed on thin-layer slides using specific monoclonalantibodies when needed. Thin-layer and direct smear diagnoses were compared withthe final cytologic or histologic diagnoses, when available. RESULTS: Our casesincluded 279 adenomatoid nodules, 15 cases of Hashimoto thyroiditis, 45follicular neoplasms, 14 Hurthle cell tumors, 58 papillary carcinomas and 1 5anaplastic carcinomas. Thin-layer preparations showed a trend toward a lowerproportion of inadequate specimens and a lower false negative rate.Cytomorphologic features showed some differences between the 2 methods. Colloidwas less frequently observed on ThinPrep slides, while nuclear detail andmicronucleoli were more easily detected with this technique. Moreover, ThinPrepappeared to be the appropriate method for the use of ancillary techniques insuspicious cases. CONCLUSION: Thin-layer cytology improves the diagnosticaccuracy of thyroid FNA and offers the possibility of performing new techniques,such as immunocytochemistry, on the same sample in order to detect malignancy aswell as the type and origin of thyroid gland neoplasms.",16514836,16514836

STUDY DESIGN: A technical feasibility study was conducted on3 modalities of sample preparation before HCII technique, 1 with a proteinasedigestion, I with PBS washing and I using the Digene sample conversion kitrecommended for ThinPrep medium preparation (Cytyc Corp., Boxborough,Massachusetts, U.S.A.). The stability of cells after storage at days 28, 60 and90 was tested on 26 positive samples (13 with high initial indices and 13 withlow initial indices). Results of HPV testing were compared to cytologic andhistologic results on a sample of 98 smears already identified as high gradesquamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) (48) or low grade squamous intraepitheliallesion (LSIL) (50). A retrospective analysis was then performed on 995 HPV testsperfornmed routinely in 2003 in terms of comparison with the correspondingcytologic and/or histologic results. RESULTS: The HCII technique after directtreatment by proteinase K appeared to be as effective as the Digene sampleconversion kit. By using the first technique, all 26 positive cases remainedpositive at 60 days, but 4 of 13 (30%) with low indices became negative at 90days. The sensitivity of HPV testing for detecting biopsy- proven cervicalintraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or worse was 100% in the 50 LSIL and 98% in the48 HSIL samples. In the retrospective study (n = 995), the cytologic diagnoses ofatypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) (n=278), LSIL (n =137) and HSIL (n = 28) were associated with a positive HPVtest in 44%, 75% and96% of cases, respectively. On a subsample of 156 patients among 278 with adiagnosis of ASC- US, the sensitivity of HPV testingfor detecting CIN 2 or worsewas 88%, specificity 57%, positive predictive value 10% and negative predictivevalue 99%.

STUDY DESIGN: As part of theHPV-PathogenlSS Study, a series of 150 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and 152carcinoma in situ (CIN) lesions were examined using immunohistochemical stainingfor LR67 and tested for HPV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with 3 primersets (MY09/11, GP5+/GP6+, SPF). Followup data were available for all SCCpatients, and 67 CIN lesions had been monitored with serial PCR for HPVclearance/persistence after cone treatment. RESULTS: 67LR expression increased inparallel with increasing grade of CIN (p = 0. 0001), with the most dramaticup-regulation upon the transition from CIN 2 to CIN 3 and further to SCC. Thisincreased expression was associated with CIN 3/cancer at OR 17.04 (95% CI7.28-39.87). The seemingly significant association of 67LR with high-risk HPV(HR-HPV) detection (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.27-3.80) was due to confounding by thehistologic grade (Mantel-Haenszel common OR = 1.118, 95% CI 0.576-2.168). Usingperformance indicators, 67LR expression was of little value as a marker of HR-HPVtype, and it did not predict clearance/persistence of HR-HPV after treatment ofCIN. Similarly, 67LR expression was not an independent prognostic factor incervical cancer. CONCLUSION: In cervical carcinogenesis, both integrin- andnonintegrin-type LRs (67LR) probably have functions complementary to each other,mediating transient early and stable adhesions, respectively. Up-regulated 67LRexpression is significantly associated with progression from CIN 2 to CIN 3 as amarker of cell proliferation. 67LR is probably orchestrated by mechanismsindependent of HR-HPV oncoproteins, which seem to be more closely associated withintegrin-type laminin receptors.",16514834,16514834

Drug imputability was assessed inthe 194 patients included; 33.5% had an exanthema with certain or likely drugimputability. Urticaria and local reactions at injection sites were the mostfrequent reactions (25% and 18.8%, respectively). Beta-lactam antibiotics,extracts for desensitization and insulins were the main drug groups involved, andaccounted for 22.8%, 17.1% and 14.2%, respectively, of the reactions. Extractsfor desensitization and insulins elicited more reactions than expected. Thisprobably reflects the referral pattern to an allergy clinic.",17106600,17106600

Subsequent drugchallenge tests were performed in selected cases. Finally, the history and testresults were evaluated to determine the imputability of each drug as the possibleculprit. In a cohort of 11,371 in- and out-patients, 131 were referred forevaluation. Twenty-nine cases of acute cutaneous drug reactions were identified,giving a prevalence of 0.33% in in-patients, 0.14% in out-patients, and 0.25%overall. Twenty-five percent of the case patients died within 6 months after thestudy period. The most common type of skin reactions were symmetricallydistributed maculo-papular exanthema and eczematous eruptions. Several more raretypes of skin reactions were each represented by a single case. Beta-lactamantibiotics and chemotherapeutics were the most common eliciting drugs. Theprevalence was lower than reported previously, but similar to a recent study.However, prospective studies are few and rarely performed in large hospitalsettings.

The secondary objectives of the study were to determinewhether there is a correlation between severity of atopic dermatitis, faceinvolvement, external ocular signs and the presence of ocular complications, andto identify risk factors for ophthalmological complications. Thirty-seven boysand 22 girls, mean age 36.2 months, with atopic dermatitis were examined. Atopicdermatitis severity was mild according to the SCORAD index (31.6 +/- 17.0).Fifteen (25.4%) children had external ocular signs, one had a nuclear cataract,11 had benign papillofollicular conjunctivitis, one had purulent bacterialconjunctivitis, one had chronic atopic blepharitis and one had amblyopia.Severity of atopic dermatitis, face involvement, and external ocular signs didnot seem to influence the incidence of ocular involvement.

However, the infiltration of neoplastic cells issometimes not florid; a condition known as ""scalp alopecia due to a clinicallyunapparent or minimally apparent neoplasm"" (SACUMAN). Neoplastic cells cannevertheless destroy hair follicles by inducing fibroplasias via inflammatorymediators, attracting inflammatory cells and/or replacing normal cellularpopulations. The infiltrative nature of such an alopecia can be unapparent oronly minimally apparent. The most common neoplasm in which an uncomplicated,minimally or unapparent scalp alopecia occurs and no infiltrate of cancer issuspected is metastatic breast carcinoma. Other causes include squamous and basalcell carcinomas, angiosarcoma, gastric carcinoma, placental site tromphoblastictumor, and mycosis fungoides. Syringoma-like proliferations can underliealopecia. It is unclear whether these proliferations are true syringomas ornormal findings. In conclusion, neoplasms causing cicatricial alopecia of thescalp are very rare, so generalizations from the limited number of case reportsare of uncertain importance. Moreover, it is likely that many cases of neoplasmscausing cicatricial alopecia of the scalp are diagnosed as inflammatory alopeciaand not neoplasms, thus depriving us of a full accounting and understanding ofthis entity. Dermatologists must be aware that in rare cases a bland scalpalopecia can represent a new or recurring, local or metastatic neoplasm.",16983449,16983449

Fifteen infants, who presentedperiocular haemangioma with functional impact on vision, received 2 mg/kgmethylprednisolone intravenously twice a day for 2 days.

Fifteen patientswith a total of 86 primary superficial basal cell carcinomas, received topicalALA and were illuminated 4 and 6 h later, both with 45 J/cm2 laser light (633+/-1nm). Fluorescence spectra were measured before and immediately after eachillumination.

We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study withlevocetirizine 5 mg and matched placebo in 30 adults who were sensitive tomosquito bites. On the third treatment day the subjects received two Aedesaegypti bites on the forearm. The size of the bite lesions and the intensity ofpruritus (visual analogue scale) were measured. Bite symptoms could be analysedin 28 subjects at 15 min and in 8 subjects at 24 h. Levocetirizine decreased thesize of wheals by 60% (p < 0.001) and accompanying pruritus by 62% (p < 0.001)compared with placebo. The effect of levocetirizine increased in a linear fashionwith the size of wheals and was most significant in the subjects with largestbite lesions. Levocetirizine also decreased the size of 24-h bite lesions by 71%(p=0.008) and accompanying pruritus by 56% (p=0.016). These results show thatprophylactic levocetirizine 5 mg is an effective treatment for both immediate anddelayed mosquito bite symptoms and is especially effective in subjects with largewheals.",16874418,16874418

Mostdemographic data were similar, whereas some behavioural data differed. Norwegianpatients reported significantly higher numbers of sexual partners than Tanzanian.Thirty-three percent of Tanzanian patients tested positive for HIV antibodies,females more often (43%) than males (26%). Approximately one-third and two-thirdsof the female HIV-positive Tanzanian STI patients had already seroconverted atthe age of 25 and 30 years, respectively. The national differences encounteredprobably reflect cultural differences, different panoramas of STI and a loweraccessibility to optimal health services in Tanzania. Lack of expectedstatistical associations between some of the data in the Tanzanian STI groupmight question the validity of the retrospectively collected data in this group,or indicate that questions not included in the questionnaire might be ofimportance.",16874417,16874417

A suction cupdevice commonly used for measurement of skin mechanics was used to provide adefined stress to the skin using the ventral forearm in 16 healthy volunteers.The integrity of the barrier function was assessed by trans-epidermal water lossand skin capacitance. In the first part of the study, changes in barrier functionwere measured following the application of standardized strain to the skinbarrier. In the second part of the study changes in skin mechanics were assessedfollowing standardized barrier removal. The Wilcoxon signed rank test andSpearman's rank correlation were used for statistical analysis. Significantincreases were established in trans-epidermal water loss (p < 0.01) withconcomitant significant decreases in capacitance (p < 0.05) following 400 mbarand 600 mbar of suction, suggesting that the mechanical integrity of the skinbarrier was disrupted. A significant increase in distensibility (p < 0.05) andhysteresis (p < 0.01) was found following stripping, relating the role of theskin barrier to the overall mechanical properties of the skin. This study showedthat the water permeability of the epidermis was significantly affected by theapplication of mechanical stress to the skin and vice versa, the mechanicalproperties of the skin were altered when the barrier was compromised. Theseobservations suggest that the mechanical strength of the skin barrier may play arole in the development of, for example, friction dermatitis and other skindiseases affected by mechanical stress.",16874414,16874414

Transforming growthfactor-beta (TGF-beta) is the key regulator in the pathogenesis of fibrosis.Accumulating evidence suggests that Wnt signalling and its effector beta-cateninalso play an important role in wound healing. The role of Wnt/beta-cateninsignalling in TGF-beta induced collagen deposition in hypertrophic scars andkeloids was studied. Transcriptional assays and Western blotting was performedusing fibroblast cell lines established from normal skin and hypertrophic scartissue. Immunohistochemical studies were performed using scar tissues. We provideevidence that TGF-beta induces activation of beta-catenin mediated transcriptionin human dermal fibroblasts via the Smad3 and p38 MAPK pathways.Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that beta-catenin protein levels areelevated in hypertrophic scar and keloid tissues.

The aim of this study was to evaluate a skinexplant model as a tool to identify topical agents with anti-proliferativeproperties in human epidermis. Re-epithelialization was initiated from a skinpunch biopsy explanted onto de-epidermized dermis and cultured at the air-liquidinterface in the presence of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor PKI166,tacrolimus or established topical anti-psoriatic drugs: betamethasone,calcipotriol, dithranol and tazarotene. Neo-epidermal extension was traced byfluorescence microscopy prior to histomorphometric analysis. PKI166 at 1 microMdecreased the mean radial outgrowth rate (-19%), frequency of BrdU-positive(-37%) and laminin 5-positive (-45%) cells, indicating reduced proliferation andmigration of neo-epidermal keratinocytes. However, the papillomatosis index andepithelial thickness were not significantly affected. Calcipotriol at 1 microMhad a similar effect on the outgrowth rate (-15%) and fraction of laminin5-stained keratinocytes (-40%). Furthermore, calcipotriol significantly reducedmean neo-epidermal thickness. Equimolar concentrations of the other testcompounds had no apparent effect on histology or outgrowth parameters.

Atotal of 1739 questionnaires was returned. In all, 23.5% of patients stated thatthey had atopic dermatitis, and 146 persons (8.4%) fulfilled our atopicdermatitis criteria after a detailed telephone interview. Of these, 111 wereexamined, and 28 (1.6%) were identified as currently suffering from atopicdermatitis. Twenty-seven patients were further evaluated: 9/27 were found to beskin prick test negative, 19/27 were skin prick test positive either to pollenand/or food allergens. Nine of 27 were challenged with the suspected foodallergen: 1/9 showed a worsening of the eczema, 3/9 had oral symptoms, and 5/9were negative. In conclusion, only 20% of adults with a positive history ofatopic dermatitis show active eczema lesions at a given time point.

Increasing knowledge about the complex immunenetwork that regulates anti-microbial responses has helped to dissect further therole of infections in atopic dermatitis. Conserved patterns of microbes arerecognized by the innate immune system, which mediates microbicidal activity,either directly or through inflammatory responses. New evidence suggests thatcomponents of the innate immune system, such as anti-microbial peptides, humourallectins, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing (NOD) proteins, andToll-like receptors not only protect from microbial invasion, but contribute toskin inflammation in atopic dermatitis. In addition, atopic patients tend todevelop Th2-dominated immune responses that weaken anti-microbial immunity. Thisimpairment of an appropriate anti-microbial defence compounded by amplifiedmicrobe-driven innate and adaptive immune responses leads to the vicious circleof skin inflammation. New microbial management in atopic dermatitis will foster awell-balanced microbial flora, which establishes natural defence mechanisms tomaintain immuno-surveillance of the skin. In addition to anti-microbialtherapies, other innate immune stimuli may suppress pro-inflammatory signals andhelp to break the vicious circle of cutaneous inflammation. To elucidate furtherthese different interactions of the skin immune system and microbes in atopicdermatitis, clinical studies and further efforts in basic research are needed.",16648910,16648910

Photochemotherapy employing psoralenscombined with UVA irradiation (PUVA) is a well-accepted therapy for palmoplantarpsoriasis. Its topical application (bath PUVA; cream PUVA) avoids the typicalside effects of orally applied psoralens. We compared the efficacy of cream PUVAtherapy with monochromatic excimer light therapy, a treatment modality employing308-nm UVB radiation generated by a new kind of light source. Ten patients withpsoriasis of the palms and soles were randomly assigned to receive cream PUVA onone side and 308-nm UVB on the contralateral side. Based on the psoriasis areaand severity index (PASI) score, clinical assessment was carried out before and 5weeks after the beginning of the study. At the end of the treatment period bothtest groups showed a remarkable PASI score reduction (308-nm UVB, 63.57%; creamPUVA, 64.64%). No relevant adverse effects were observed, except for mildirritation in a few patients. After a 12-week follow-up, a relapse of the diseasewas only observed in one patient. Thus, mono-chromatic excimer light clearedpalmoplantar psoriasis as rapidly as cream PUVA. In contrast to cream PUVA,monochromatic excimer light therapy is not associated with prior drugapplication. This might lead to a lower incidence of adverse reactions and bettercompliance. Therefore, monochromatic excimer light therapy seems to be a usefulnew therapeutic option for palmoplantar psoriasis.",16585984,16585984

Spontaneous clearance ofHPV infection is accompanied by humoral and cellular immune response againstvirus-specific antigens. Two vaccines, prophylactic and therapeutic ones, areconsidered. Prophylactic vaccines use L1 and L2 capsid proteins to induceproduction of conformationally-specific antibodies. They block HPV infection.Lone L1 and L2 proteins self-assemble into a capsid that is identical to thecomplete virion. In this way, an antibody-mediated response is induced before thebody actually comes into contact with the live virion. Therapeutic vaccines arebeing developed to protect HPV-positive persons against tumor development. Forthese vaccines, researchers are targeting the activity of the E6 and E7oncoproteines.On June 8, 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved an HPV vaccine for clinical use. The HPV vaccine that has been approvedis the quadrivalent vaccine that consists of recombinant viral-like particles(VLPs) of HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 mixed with an aluminum-containing adjuvant. It ismanufactured by Merck & Co., Inc. and sold under the name of Gardasil?. The newvaccine is approved for use in females 9-26 years of age. The primary targetpopulation for vaccination should be females aged 11-12 years. However,vaccination can be given to girls as young as 9 years of age. Vaccination canreceive women aged 13-26 years who have been sexually active. There are still nodata on the vaccine efficacy in women older than 26, and currently no data todemonstrate the efficacy of vaccination in males; male subjects should not bevaccinated until such data become available. The vaccine is to be administeredintramuscularly either into the deltoid muscle of the arm or the highanteriolateral area of the leg. Each patient receives three 0.5 mL doses givenaccording to the following schedule: first dose is given at the elected date,second dose two months after the first dose, and third dose six months after thefirst dose. According to statements from Merck, the list price of the vaccine is120 USD per dose. GlaxoSmithKline is now conducting a phase III trial of abivalent (HPV 16, 18) vaccine, and it is going to be presented under the name ofCervarix. Similar results to those obtained with the quadrivalent HPV vaccinehave been reported with the bivalent vaccine. It is expected to be released inJune next year. Evaluation of the HPV vaccine efficiency in preventing dysplasiaand cancer has been recommended as a globally accepted endpoint for populationbased studies.",17010274,17010274

The study also aimed to analyze correlations between the levelof examined proteins and parameters such as skin prick test (SPT) results, serumconcentration of total IgE, and coexistence of symptoms of other atopic diseases.The study included 30 AD patients and two control groups: 30 patients sufferingfrom chronic urticaria and 30 healthy individuals. The mean level of eosinophilproteins measured in serum and urine of AD patients was higher than that incontrols, although a significant difference was only recorded for serum and urinelevel of eosinophil protein X (EPX). Patients with very severe/severe ADpresented higher levels of eosinophil proteins than patients presenting withmild/moderate AD, although no significant difference was found between these twogroups.

Of course, a decline ofserum antigen specific IgE in the course of such a treatment cannot explain theclinical efficacy of SIT and is probably not a key mechanism. However, SIT may atleast participate in the final clinical result. In this study, 37 patients withatopic dermatitis were treated with allergy vaccines (Novo-Helisen Depot) for atime period of 48 months. The control group consisted of 29 patients with atopicdermatitis who were treated with classical methods. The clinical score (W-AZS),total IgE and antigen specific IgE (asIgE) in the sera of patients were assessedbefore treatment and after 24 and 48 months of therapy (FEIA CAP System,Pharmacia). There was a significant difference between the two investigatedgroups from both the clinical and immunological standpoints after 2 and 4 yearsof observation. There was a significant decrease of serum total IgE and asIgE(directed against airborne allergens) in the course of specific immunotherapy. Inthe control group, the total IgE level tended to increase, and this tendency wasalso recorded in case of asIgE measurements. We also evaluated the influence ofspecific immunotherapy on the serum level of IFN-G, sIL-2R, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10before treatment and after 4 years of therapy with the quantitative 2-stepcolorimetric sandwich ELISA method (R and D Systems). In the group of patientstreated with allergy vaccines, a significant decrease of the serum sIL-2R levelwas observed after 48 months of therapy (p<0.01). In the control group, asignificant increase of serum IL-4 (p<0.01) as well as IL-5 (p<0.05) wasregistered at the end of the observation period.

The ""sensitivity"" of food sIgE determinations is, for example,suboptimal with unstable allergens in fruits and vegetables that are involved inthe (birch) pollen-related immediate oral allergy syndromes. In this particularsyndrome the history is often conclusive and can be substantiated by skin pricktests with fresh foods. The ""sensitivity"" of sIgE tests is much better when sIgEare directed to stable plant or animal food allergens which often causenon-immediate generalized reactions. Foods, usually, contain many different(glyco)proteinic allergens of which some are stable and others not. The""sensitivity"" of the sIgE test with a particular food, therefore, variesaccording to the type of allergen that is recognized by the patient. The""specificity"" of sIgE tests with foods is affected by the existence of homologousfood allergens which induce cross-reactive IgE that may or may not be clinicallyrelevant. While variable, clinical cross-reactivity is more common amongbotanically-related fruits, among different nuts, among mammalian foods and amongseafood than among cereals, grains and legumes.

Deficiency ofantioxidants like vitamin-E has been reported to trigger this progression. Themain aims of our study were to measure plasma vitamin-E levels in nonalcoholicfatty liver disease (NAFLD), to explain its relationship with biochemicalparameters and to examine the possible therapeutic and prophylactic role ofvitamin-E. METHODS: 52 patients with NAFLD and elevated liver function tests wereenrolled. After 6 months of follow-up with a standard low-fat, low-calorie diet,changes in liver enzymes were evaluated. RESULTS: Deficiency of vitamin-E wasdetected in 16 patients with NAFLD. Homogenous echo pattern of the liver andattenuation was found to be significantly higher in the low vitamin-E group (p =0.03). The low vitamin-E group had significantly higher levels of triglyceride (p= 0.02). After 6 months, patients in the low vitamin-E group did not respond tothe diet and no decrease in ALT levels was detected (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Thisis the first study measuring the serum vitamin-E levels in nonalcoholic fattyliver disease. A correlation was found between low vitamin-E levels, hightriglyceride levels, as well as sonographic findings, both of which are negativeprognostic factors causing progression of fatty liver to steatohepatitis.Patients with low vitamin-E levels did not respond to a classical diet for fattyliver disease.

Studies dating back to the 80ties and the 90ties haveshown 30% of anemia among inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Morerecently, the broader use of immunosuppressive drug and infliximab allowingbetter mucosal healing as well as a more aggressive treatment of anemia,including the use of safer form of IV iron, may have influenced the prevalence ofanemia among IBD patients. Our aim was to asses the prevalence andcharacteristics of anemia among two cohorts of IBD patients at 10 years intervaland to look for associated clinical or demographic factors. METHODS: Using theIBD patients register of one senior gastroenterologist, we identified IBDpatients he had consecutively seen and who had blood test at the outpatientclinic during the years 1993 and 2003. Demographic and clinical characteristics,treatment for Crohn's disease, blood test results and treatment of anemia wererecorded and compared between these two cohorts. Anemia was defined as anhemoglobin level lower than the normal value of the laboratory of our hospital.RESULTS: 80 and 90 patients were identified in 1993 and 2003, respectively. Therewas no significant difference between the two cohorts, according to age, gender,disease type, duration or location. There were 27/80 (33.8%) and 15/90 (16.7%)anemic patients in 1993 and 2003, respectively (P = 0.013). The prevalence ofsevere anemia (hemoglobin level < 10.5 g/100 ml) was similar in the two cohorts(6.3% and 5.6%). Characteristics of the anemia were similar in the two cohortswith a majority of iron deficiency anemia and inflammatory anemia. Ferritin andCRP levels were not significantly different in the two cohorts.

METHODS: A prospective study including 19 consecutivepregnant women with anemia and heterozygous hemoglobinopathy was performed.Treatment was divided into two phases: the initial low-dose phase and thesubsequent high-rhEPO phase. In the initial phase, 3 x 10,000 U of rhEPO wasadministered with intravenous iron sucrose. In patients showing a poor response(Hb increase <1 g/dl) to low-dose rhEPO, the rhEPO dose was increased to 20,000 Uper treatment in the subsequent phase. RESULTS: All patients showed stimulationof erythropoiesis as evidenced by an increase in hemoglobin. In 13 patients, agood response to therapy was observed (mean Hb increase 1.6 +/- 0.5 g/dl). In 6patients, resistance to rhEPO was noted (mean Hb increase 0.5 +/- 0.5 g/dl). Themean gestational age at the start of therapy was 28 weeks of gestation and at theend 32 weeks.

Iron overload and inflammation increasehepcidin expression, whereas anemia and hypoxia suppress it. In the present studyprohepcidin levels were determined in the serum of hemodialysis (HD) patients andits correlations with iron metabolism markers, C-reactive protein (CRP) andhematocrit (Hct) were assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-sixHD patients and 22healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. Hct, serum prohepcidin, CRP, iron,ferritin, transferrin saturation and transferrin receptors were measured. Theweekly erythropoietin dose, last-month intravenous iron dose and the patients'demographics were recorded. RESULTS: In comparison to the healthy volunteers, theHD patients had higher serum ferritin, transferrin receptors and CRP, lower serumiron and similar transferrin saturation and prohepcidin levels. In the patientgroup prohepcidin levels were negatively correlated with Hct but not with anyother of the examined parameters. Multiple linear regression analysis consideringage, inflammation, iron adequacy, erythropoietin dose and prohepcidin levelsrevealed that prohepcidin was the predominant determinant of Hct. CONCLUSIONS:Taking into account the low Hct levels in the HD patients of our study, it seemsplausible that the prohepcidin levels assessed in this group are inappropriatelyhigh. These functionally high prohepcidin levels may be associated with thefactors that inhibit erythropoiesis in HD patients.

Cell counts were performed before and after cryopreservation,but only after thawing were the cell counts used for correlation with early andlong-term engraftment. The number of CD34+/CD38- cells infused correlated withthe neutrophil (r = 0.88, p < 0.005) and platelet counts (r = 0.67, p < 0.05) at12 months after PBSCT. This correlation was better than that for the total CD34+cell dose at 12 months (r = 0.36, p = 0.09 for neutrophil count and r = 0.48, p =0.06 for platelets count).

To determine whether PUVA treatment affected stromal regulation ofadherent hematopoietic cell survival, mature stromal layers, incubated with 8-MOPand exposed to UVA light, were cocultured with nonadherent mononuclear cells fromnormal marrow. After 24 h, the percentage of apoptotic hematopoietic cellprecursors was quantified by flow cytometry. This study provides evidences thatthe in vitro exposure of human stromal cell precursors to UVA light, in thepresence of 8-MOP, inhibits stromal layer generation by inducing apoptosis, asevidenced by annexin V staining following 7 days of culture. Here, we show anadditional cell target for this psoralen following UVA irradiation. However, in asecond set of experiments, PUVA treatment did not affect the stromal capacity tosupport hematopoiesis in culture. Our results can contribute to a betterdefinition of ECP mechanisms of action for future development of experimentaldesigns and clinical applications of this intriguing procedure.",17016038,17016038

In thispaper, we investigated the changes of protein kinase C (PKC) activity inperipheral blood T lymphocytes and the effect of PKC on the peripheral blood Tlymphocyte proliferation and apoptosis in ITP children. We demonstrated that Tlymphocytes from ITP children were more susceptible to the activator (phorbolmyristate acetate) and the inhibitor (H-7) of PKC. In ITP children, phorbolmyristate acetate and H-7 dramatically affected T lymphocyte proliferation andapoptosis, but altered little in healthy children. Compared with healthychildren, PKC activity was significantly enhanced in ITP children, increasing theexpressions of Fas ligand on CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, indicating positivecorrelations between PKC activity and the expressions of Fas ligand on T cells,while the relations between PKC activity and platelet count showed negativecorrelations. Taken together, our findings suggest that PKC signal transductionsmay participate in the procedure of T lymphocyte proliferation and apoptosis inITP children. PKC activation may enhance T lymphocyte activity, suppress T cellapoptosis, and be involved in thrombocyte damage, which can be related to theimmunity pathogenesis of ITP.",17016035,17016035

This causes hypercalcemia. When leftuntreated, hypercalcemia leads to nephrocalcinosis, impairment of kidneyfunction, and eventually renal failure. Some degree of renal dysfunction iscommon in myeloma patients. Here, we report case studies showing the efficacy andrenal safety of the single-nitrogen bisphosphonate, ibandronate, for thetreatment of hypercalcemia and/or nephrocalcinosis in multiple myeloma patientshospitalized with acute renal failure. Patients (n = 7) received either one ortwo intravenous infusions of ibandronate (2-6 mg). Ibandronate was well toleratedin all patients and returned elevated blood calcium levels to normal. Renalfunction improved for all patients and normalized in 3/7 patients. We concludethat ibandronate is involved in rapidly improving or restoring acute renalfunction and calcium levels to within the normal range in this patientpopulation. To clarify the exact value of ibandronate, further investigation iswarranted in randomized prospective trials.",17016034,17016034

Epidemiologic studies aimed at understandingthis rise have revealed some association with occupational exposure. NHL iscommon among farmers, where pesticides have been described as the culprit. Theassociation between pesticides and NHL has been demonstrated mainly incase-control studies, while retrospective cohorts have been less convincing.Pesticides including chlorphenol and phenoxyacetic acid herbicides,organochlorines, and organophosphate insecticides, carbamates, and fungicideshave been associated with NHL. Although the causality has not been clearlyproven, both genotoxic and nongenotoxic mechanisms for lymphomagenesis have beenproposed.

We describe a 50-year-oldmale patient who had originally presented with pancytopenia in October 1992. Thediagnosis of a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) FAB subtype RAEB-t was establishedin April 1993 by histological bone marrow (BM) examination, and therapy withlow-dose cytosine arabinoside was initiated. In a phase of partial hematologicalremission, cytogenetic assessment in August 1993 revealed a ring chromosome 1 in13 of 21 metaphases beside BM cells with normal karyotypes[46,XY,r(1)(p35q31)/46,XY]. One month later, the patient progressed to an acutemyeloid leukemia (AML), subtype M4 with 40% BM blasts and cytogenetic examinationshowed clonal evolution by the appearance of additional numerical aberrations inaddition to the ring chromosome [46,XY,r(1),+8,-21/45,XY,r(1),+8,-21,-22/46, XY].Intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy was applied to induce remission inpreparation for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from the patient'sHLA-compatible son. After BMT, complete remission was clinically, hematologicallyand cytogenetically (normal male karyotype) confirmed. A complete hematopoieticchimerism was demonstrated. A relapse in January 1997 was successfully treatedusing donor lymphocyte infusion and donor peripheral blood stem cells (PB-SC) incombination with GM-CSF as immunostimulating agent in April 1997, and thepatient's clinical condition remained stable as of January 2005. This is aninteresting case of a patient with AML secondary to MDS. With the ring chromosome1 we also describe a rare cytogenetic abnormality that predicted the poorprognosis of the patient, but the patient could be cured by adoptiveimmunotherapy and the application of donor's PB-SC. This case confirms the valueof cytogenetic analysis in characterizing the malignant clone in hematologicalneoplasias, the importance of controlling the quality of an induced remission andof the detection of a progress of the disease.",16914909,16914909

However, a systematic study of the subject has never beenattempted. All case reports of myocardial infarction or other arterial occlusionshave been now gathered and properly evaluated from a cardiological point of view.Thirty-six patients with myocardial infarction and 6 patients with documentedcerebrovascular event were retrieved from the literature. The age of the patientsvaried between 7 and 79 years, with a mean of 44 years. In 16 cases, the arterialocclusion occurred in men <40 years of age. The majority of myocardialinfarctions (MIs) were anterolateral (12 cases). Posterior-inferior MI waspresent in 6 cases whereas it was of the non-Q type in 4 patients. It wasmultiple in 6 cases, and in the remaining patients the type of infarction couldnot be determined. In 26 cases, the thrombotic event (22 myocardial infarctionsand 4 ischemic cerebrovascular accidents) occurred during or after the infusionof factor VIII concentrates and, more frequently, after prothrombin complexconcentrates (activated or non-activated ones) or recombinant factor VIIapreparations. In 3 cases, the vascular complication occurred after intravenousdesmopressin administration. MI was fatal in 7 instances. After the event, signsand symptoms of heart failure were seen as sequels in 7 patients. One patient hadto undergo cardiac transplant 5 months after the MI. No death occurred afterischemic cerebrovascular accidents. Since not all hemophilia patients developinhibitors and therefore are not usually treated with activated concentrates,this series of patients is somewhat biased and does not allow generalconclusions. The high prevalence of MI and other arterial complications whichoccurred after transfusion therapy, usually in patients with inhibitors, clearlyindicates the need for a careful evaluation of the appropriate therapeuticapproach in each single patient.",16914907,16914907

In this study, 139 Thai CMLpatients were followed for a median period of 3 years (range 18-43 months).Clinical presentations of both BCR-ABL gene variant groups (73% e14a2+ and 27%e13a2+) were similar, although e14a2+ patients tended to be older (42 vs. 37years) and had higher white blood cell counts than e13a2+ patients. The majorityof patients in both groups presented with Sokal stage 2-3 (score >0.8) and werecategorized as Hasford's intermediate- to high-risk groups (score >780). Allpatients received oral chemotherapy and 13% underwent allogeneic stem celltransplantation. None received oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In theconventional chemotherapy group, the overall survival (OS) rate was slightlybetter in e14a2+ than in e13a2+ patients (p = n.s.). The median survival ine14a2+ and e13a2+ patients who did not receive stem cell transplantation was 49and 33 months, respectively (p = n.s.). The type of blastic crisis in e14a2+ ande13a2+ patients was similar, being predominantly myeloid. In conclusion, CMLpatients in Thailand, despite being much younger, had a comparable OS with thosein the Western countries, with no different OS between e14a2+ and e13a2+patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patient group consisted of candidates forelective operations requiring blood transfusions in order to raise hemoglobin(Hb) concentrations rapidly and for whom oral iron administration is useless andcompliance with long-term treatment is definitely impossible due to socioculturalfactors. Sixty-two children were included in the study. Venous blood samples weretaken at diagnosis, and after 1 week and 1, 2 and 3 months. Hb, hematocrit,erythrocyte indices (mean erythrocyte volume, mean erythrocyte Hb and meanerythrocyte Hb concentration), serum iron (SI) levels, iron binding capacity,transferrin receptor (CD71) and serum ferritin levels were measured. Iron sucrosewas used as an intravenous iron preparation. RESULTS: All children showedimprovements in iron deficiency anemia. A statistically significant elevationoccurred between the time of diagnosis and week 1 (p<0.05) in nearly allparameters. SI was raised until at least 1 month of therapy. There was nosignificant difference between transferrin receptors measured before and afterthe intravenous iron therapy. Ferritin did not exceed the values achieved in the1st month. Mild side effects were encountered in only 8 (12.9%) patients.Treatment was not discontinued because of side effects in any case.

We investigatedthe expression of PPARgamma and the effects of PPARgamma ligands on UTree-O2,Bay91 and 380, three B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cell lines witht(14;18), which show a poor prognosis, accompanying c-myc abnormality. Westernblot analysis identified expression of PPARgamma protein and real-time PCR thatof PPARgamma mRNA on the three cell lines. Troglitazone (TGZ), a syntheticPPARgamma ligand, inhibited cell growth in these cell lines in a dose-dependentmanner, which was associated with G(1) cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We alsofound this effect PPARgamma independent since PPARgamma antagonists failed toreverse this effect. We assessed the expression of c-myc, an apoptosis-regulatorygene, since c-myc abnormality was detected in most B-ALL cells with t(14;18). TGZwas found to dose-dependently downregulate the expression of c-myc mRNA and c-mycprotein in the three cell lines. These results suggest that TGZ inhibits cellgrowth via induction of G(1) cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in these cell linesand that TGZ-induced apoptosis, at least in part, may be related to thedownregulation of c-myc expression. Moreover, the downregulation of c-mycexpression by TGZ may depend on a PPARgamma-independent mechanism.

We looked for temporal changes in lung function and characteristicsthat would predict the development of PFT abnormalities. In 1996, 18 patientswith major beta-thalassemia (9 males and 9 females; age range: 18-35 years) and11 patients with intermediate beta-thalassemia (5 males and 6 females; age range:25-51 years) underwent clinical assessment and PFT, including bodyplethysmography and gas transfer study (carbon monoxide diffusion capacity,DL(CO)). Patients were reassessed in 2003. An echocardiographic evaluation wasalso obtained to exclude pulmonary hypertension. In 55.5% of major and 45.4% ofintermediate beta-thalassemia patients, a restrictive pattern was found in 1996;in 2003 only 38.8 and 27.2% of patients, respectively, exhibited total lungcapacities below the predicted values. DL(CO) was unchanged in both groups ofpatients, being reduced in 5 thalassemia major patients and within the normalrange in intermediate patients.

We assessed theresponse of platelet count and CD62p expression after eradication therapy inpatients with ITP and H. pylori infection. METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectivelystudied 15 ITP patients diagnosed with H. pylori infection by serology and breathtest. A follow-up breath test was used to document eradication. Two out of 15patients showed improvement in platelet counts after 6 months, 1 of which mayhave had drug-induced thrombocytopenia. Overall, certain platelet response ratein our series was 6.7% (1/15). We found that platelet CD62p expression by flowcytometry was elevated in 10/15 (66.7%) H. pylori-infected patients, which is astatistically significant difference when compared with 3/33 (9.1%) control ITPpatients seronegative for H. pylori (p = 0.002). In addition, eradication therapydecreased CD62p expression (p = 0.04). However, reduction in platelet activationwas not associated with an increase in platelet counts (mean 72.4 x 10(9)/lbefore and 68.7 after therapy; p = 0.4). CONCLUSION: In our series, plateletactivation was common in ITP patients with H. pylori, and eradication therapydecreased platelet activation but seldom increased platelet counts. Increasedplatelet CD62p expression is a putative link between chronic infections andatherosclerosis, but further study is needed to clarify the implications of ourobservation.",16809885,16809885

Thirty-three suffered from HIT or suspected HIT, and 1child without HIT had a high bleeding risk. All children had severe underlyingproblems increasing their thrombotic and/or bleeding risk. HIT diagnosis wasconfirmed serologically or clinically in 26 cases (78.8%). Danaparoid regimenswere similar to those used in adults, but in general, younger children neededhigher daily doses of danaparoid to achieve the same target plasma anti-Xa levelsthan teenagers or adults. Of those with a known outcome 28/33 children (84.8%)survived, 7 having suffered from a serious adverse event. Five deaths occurredincluding 1 thrombotic and 2 major bleeds.

However, the application of LMWH in pediatric patients hasnot been supported by a single controlled study so far. Furthermore, there is noofficial approval of these drugs for children. In this pilot study 27 childrenwith deep venous thromboses (DVT) were treated with the LMWH enoxaparin at adosage of 1.5 mg/kg body weight b.i.d. in neonates and infants and 1 mg/kg bodyweight b.i.d. in children. This dosage was lowered for prophylaxis if therapeuticsuccess was achieved. The aim of the study was to investigate both, efficacy withrespect to patency rates and safety during acute and long-term follow-up.Sufficient therapeutic success required a rapid production of anti-Xa targetactivity and was reached in 85% of the treated patients, who showed patency ofthe affected vessel at last follow-up. The mean duration of treatment with fulldosage was 16.5 days, followed by prophylaxis over a mean duration of 9.8 months.Rethrombosis or adverse events including heparin-induced thrombocytopenia werenot observed in any patient.

Their incidence and the associated risk factorshave rarely been identified in injured children. METHODS: Severely injuredchildren (age <18 years; admitted in a pediatric intensive care unit or length ofstay > or = 72 h) with a discharge diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE; deepvenous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism) were identified from theinstitutional trauma registry between January 1, 1999 and April 31, 2002. Thestudy centers included a dedicated pediatric trauma center and an adult traumacenter with pediatric patients. Risk factors for VTE were identified usingmultivariate analysis. RESULTS: VTE was found in 11 of the 3,291 admissions, fora rate of 3.3/1,000 admissions. Children with VTE were older and had higherInjury Severity Scores. Independent risk factors for VTE included thoracicinjuries [odds ratio (OR): 6.9; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4-35.1] andspinal injuries (OR: 37.4; 95% CI: 3.5-396.7).

DESIGN AND METHODS: Total plasmin generation was measured invenous plasma from umbilical cords and adults, on plastic and cell surfaces, inthe presence of fibrin monomer, Desafib. Plasminogen, its inhibitorsalpha2-antiplasmin and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, andplasmin-alpha2-antiplasmin complex in the time samples were assayed byenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effect of addition of plasminogen on theplasmin generation in cord plasma and the effect of lipoprotein on adult and cordplasmin generation were measured. RESULTS: On the surface of human umbilical veinendothelial cells, onset of plasmin generation was earlier (40 min) compared toplastic (60 min) but total plasmin generation was similar on both surfaces. Theaddition of plasminogen to cord plasma increased plasmin generation.Supplementation of lipoprotein in adult plasma had an inhibitory effect, butthere was no significant effect in cord plasma. INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS:Plasmin generation is reduced in newborn compared to adult plasma. Decreasedplasmin generation in cord plasma is likely due to decreased plasminogenconcentration.

In this study, we investigated themechanisms of cytotoxic effects of depsipeptide (FK228), one of the mosteffective HDAC inhibitors against leukemia, using human myeloid leukemic celllines HL-60 and K562. We found that FK228 activated caspase-9 and a subsequentcaspase cascade by perturbing the mitochondrial membrane to release cytochrome c,which was almost completely blocked by overexpression of Bcl-2. The mitochondrialdamage was caused by the translocation of Bax but not other pro-apoptotic Bcl-2family proteins to the mitochondria. FK228 did not affect the interaction betweenBax and Bax adaptor proteins such as 14-3-3theta and Ku70. FK228-inducedapoptosis and mitochondrial translocation of Bax were markedly enhanced by theproteasome inhibitor bortezomib. The synergistic action of FK228 and bortezomibwas at least partly mediated through conformational changes in Bax, whichfacilitate its translocation to the mitochondria. These results suggest that thecombination of HDAC inhibitors and proteasome inhibitors is useful in thetreatment of leukemia especially in the context of molecular-targeted therapy.The status of Bcl-2 and Bax may influence the sensitivity of tumors to thiscombination and thus can be a target of further therapeutic intervention.",16424655,16424655

This is the largest series from asingle centre with 6 patients diagnosed over a 6-year period. Two thirds of thepatients had a simultaneous diagnosis of TTP and SLE. Half of the patients had apositive Coombs test along with clear features of TTP. Five patients receivedplasmapheresis as initial treatment while 1 patient received plasma infusionsonly. Four out of 5 patients responded to plasmapheresis and only 1 patientrequired cytotoxic therapy. TTP in association with SLE appears to beunderdiagnosed and a positive Coombs test is not against the diagnosis of TTP inthis setting. Most of the patients respond well to plasmapheresis.

Three hundred andsixty-five unrelated normal individuals and 100 vWD patients (type 1: 18; type 2:21; type 3: 61) were analyzed for the two vWF intron 40 VNTR markers. Polymerasechain reaction of the two markers vWF1 and vWF2 was done using specific primersfollowed by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gel. VNTR analysis revealed thepresence of VNTR9 and VNTR15 along with the eight alleles VNTR6 to VNTR14 in thevWF1 marker. Furthermore, apart from the six alleles, VNTR1 to VNTR6 of the vWF2marker, two new alleles, VNTR7 and VNTR8, were also found. The heterozygosityrates were 75 and 74% for vWF1 and vWF2, respectively. Overall, theheterozygosity rate, i.e. when both vWF1 and vWF2 were considered in combination,was 81%. These data were successfully applied for the detection of carriers in 10severe type 3 vWD families. The high heterozygosity of the two vWF intron 40 VNTRmarkers and the simplicity of the technique without much cost being involvedsuggest the practical feasibility of this technique in developing countries likeIndia.",16424652,16424652

The same is true for the assumption of oralcontraceptives. Available information mainly deals with von Willebrand's disease,factor XI (FXI) deficiency and carriers of hemophilia A. Data concerning patientswith congenital prothrombin complex factor deficiencies are very scanty. In thepresent study, data of a total of 27 women are presented, 11 patients withhomozygous or double heterozygous deficiencies of FII, FVII and FX, together with16 cases of hemophilia B carriers. The patients with FII, FVII or FX defects hada total of 14 pregnancies and often needed transfusion therapy. Proper managementresulted in a decrease in postpartum bleeding and satisfactory fetal outcome.Elective cesarean delivery seems indicated only in recent years. Carriers ofhemophilia B had a total of 19 pregnancies but showed no bleeding and needed nosubstitutive therapy. Searching the literature, we discovered only 9 additionalpatients with prothrombin deficiency or FX deficiency, having a total of 16pregnancies. On the contrary, there were at least 17 additional patients withFVII deficiency, with a total of 21 pregnancies. The management of the diseaseshas been variable, but in substantial agreement with the personal observations.Oral contraceptive therapy was administered in some of our patients and in a fewadditional cases described in the literature. Medication was always welltolerated and patients who took it for a long period of time showed a decrease inmenometrorrhagia and an improvement in hematocrit levels.

Six years ago, low-doseintravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment of childhood ITP was started at thePediatric Hematology Unit, Ain Shams University, while intravenous anti-D hasbeen introduced in Egypt in 2001. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safetyof intravenous anti-D compared to low-dose IVIG in the treatment of children withchronic ITP. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized trial comprised 34 patientswith chronic ITP (18 boys and 16 girls) with recurrent bleeding episodes. Medianage of the patients was 6.5 years, duration of thrombocytopenia was > 6 months,and platelet count (PC) was < 30 x 10(9)/l (30 K). The patient cohort was dividedinto two subgroups: group A comprised 18 patients treated with anti-D in a doseof 50 microg/kg i.v. initially, and in 12 of them repeated doses (50 microg/kg)were given every 4 weeks, and group B consisted of 16 children who received IVIGin a dose of 250 mg/kg for 2 consecutive days. Bleeding manifestations, completeblood cell and reticulocyte counts were assessed at baseline and 3, 7, 14 and 28days after infusion. RESULTS: Clinically, more than 80% of the patients (82.3%)showed good control of bleeding. On day 3, 33.3% of group A versus 37.5% of groupB, and on day 7: 66.6% of group A versus 75% of group B patients demonstrated agood response (PC > 50 K and/or doubling of baseline PC). On days 14 and 21, nosignificant changes in PCs were observed between both groups. However, only 11.1%of group A and 12.5% of group B patients could maintain PC > 100 K on day 28,while 38.8 versus 37.5% of group A and group B, respectively, still had PC > or =double the initial count. The peak response to anti-D was noticed 7 and 14 daysfollowing infusion and to IVIG on days 3 and 7. Repeated doses of anti-D couldmaintain PC > 50 K (or > double the baseline PC) in 75% of patients 1 week afterinfusion, and in 60% of them by day 28, with good control of bleeding.Splenectomy was postponed and/or avoided in 4 (33.3%) patients on anti-Dmaintenance therapy who experienced recurrent severe bleeding episodes beforestarting therapy. The safety of anti-D was judged by the degree of intravascularhemolysis. The mean hemoglobin decrease was 0.8 +/- 0.4 g/dl; in 61.1% ofpatients the Hb level dropped but none of them experienced a drop of more than 3g/dl or required transfusion. CONCLUSION: Both single intravenous anti-D andlow-dose IVIG effectively increased PC in children with chronic ITP at risk ofbleeding or those with previous bleeding episodes. Repeated doses of anti-D couldmaintain PC above the critical values or double baseline counts in nearly twothirds of the patients showing good control of bleeding and may serve as analternative to splenectomy in these patients.",16424649,16424649

We conducted a retrospective review of oursingle center experience in China between 1990 and 2003 with splenectomy forchronic ITP in children in order to determine the initial and long-termhematological response, morbidity, mortality, predictors of response tosplenectomy and the therapy in children who failed splenectomy. Of 65 childrenanalyzed, the overall immediate clinical response to splenectomy was 89.2%. Themedian postsplenectomy follow-up time was 52 months (8-124). During follow-up, 9children (13.8%) relapsed within a median time of 6 months (2-58). The overallmorbidity was 1.5% and perioperative mortality was zero. During follow-up, 1child died of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and 1 died of overwhelmingpostsplenectomy infection (OPSI). The platelet count at day 7 after splenectomywas a predictor of a sustained response to splenectomy but no preoperativeparameters were predictors of the response to splenectomy. Of the 15 children whofailed splenectomy, excluding the one who died of ICH, only 2 childrenintermittently required corticosteroids and IVIG. Splenectomy is a potentialtherapy to provide long-term control of disease in children with chronic ITP andis associated with low morbidity and mortality. The risk of fulminant sepsisremains an omnipresent concern. Antipneumococcal vaccination and antibioticprophylaxis should be recommended and children should receive timely and adequateantibiotics for bacteria infection to lessen the problem of OPSI.",16424648,16424648

Forty-five patients were enrolled, including 18 children (10 withacute lymphoblastic leukemia, 6 with high-grade lymphoma, and 2 with acutemyeloid leukemia) and 27 adults (8 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 4 withhigh-grade lymphoma, 9 with multiple myeloma, and 6 with acute myeloid leukemia).The age ranged from 3 to 98 years, with a median age of 7 years in children and59.3 years in adults. There were 14 males and 4 females in the pediatric groupand 18 males and 9 females in the adult group. Rasburicase 0.2 mg/kg wasadministered intravenously once a day for 2-6 days, for a median of 3 days inchildren and of 4 days in adults. After 3 days of treatment, the median uric acidlevels in the 18 children decreased from 10.5 mg/dl (range 8-18.6) to 0.5 mg/dl(range 0.0-1.7). Similarly, in the 27 adults, the median levels decreased from10.8 mg/dl (range 8-24.4) to 0.5 mg/dl (range 0.0-1.6). No significant changeswere observed in serum potassium, calcium, and phosphorus concentrations. None ofthe patients required dialysis for acute renal failure.

Dose reduction and therapyattenuation reduced treatment-related toxicity, but also decreased therapeuticefficacy. In elderly patients too, the achievement of complete remission is themost important prognostic factor affecting outcome. Therefore, we have treatedelderly patients with a dose-intensified protocol. Aim of the study was to verifythe feasibility of this scheme in a subset of patients with high-risk aggressivelymphomas. METHODS: Between June 2002 and June 2004, 26 patients over the age of60 years with a diagnosis of aggressive NHL and an intermediate-high or highInternational Prognostic Index were treated with biweekly CHOP plus rituximabwith the support of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF). RESULTS:Seventeen patients (65%) regularly kept the interval between cycles.Haematological and extrahaematological toxicities were moderate in all thepatients. Twenty (77%) patients achieved complete remissions, 6 (23%) partialremissions with an overall response rate of 100%. After a median follow-up of 23months, the overall survival was 79%; after a median follow-up of 17 months, thedisease-free survival was 70%. CONCLUSION: These results confirm that adose-dense CHOP programme can be administered safely and effectively in a subsetof elderly patients with high-risk aggressive NHL. The addition of rituximabcould increase the response rate without adding toxicity.",16424645,16424645

CAD causes ischemia as a prelude to angina, myocardialinfarction and heart failure as specific forms of heart disease causing a declinein the quality of life. CAD or atherosclerosis and the resulting myocardialischemia trigger a natural angiogenic response that generates collateralcirculations. The long-term goal for these studies is to develop therapeuticangiogenesis that augments the natural coronary angiogenesis. This project makesuse of an infarcted transgenic mouse model to characterize formation of thosecollateral circulations in the post-infraction heart. The experiments utilizedthoracotomy and a microcauterizer to produce an infarct in transgenic mice andthis stimulated neovascularization and allowed labeling of the coronary vessels,thereby defining the morphogenic processes involved in formation of collateralcirculations. The results show that the heart consistently responds to infarctswith angiogenesis at 1d post-treatment (PT) that undergoes transition intovascular remodeling at 7d PT with complete remodeling at 14d PT. The vascularremodeling appears to mitigate any net increase in perfusion that may be achievedearly in coronary angiogenesis.

Induction of c-fosmRNA due to 4-AP-elicited convulsion was detected by means of the polymerasechain reaction (PCR) in samples from the neocortex. Adult male rats werepretreated with different doses of dexamethasone (0.5, 1, 3, 5mg/kg body weight);1h later 5mg/kg 4-AP was injected intraperitoneally. Controls received thesolvent of dexamethasone. Pretreatment with dexamethasone provided significantsymptomatic protection against 4-AP-induced convulsions. Immunohistochemistry wasused to evaluate the presence of the c-fos protein. The number ofFos-immunoreactive nuclei per section area was measured in the neocortex andhippocampus. Pretreatment with dexamethasone resulted in a dose-dependent,significant decrease of seizure-induced Fos-protein immunoreactivity in theneocortex, in the hilum of the dentate fascia, as well as in regions CA1-3 of thehippocampus, compared to control animals. Brains processed for mRNA isolation andPCR, displayed a significant increase of c-fos mRNA following the 4-AP treatment,while pretreatment with dexamethasone did not prevent or decrease this boostedc-fos mRNA expression. We conclude that seizure-induced c-fos expression andintracellular Fos-protein localization are mediated by transmitter and receptorsystems, and dexamethasone significantly decreases Fos immunoreactivity, probablyby regulating the intracellular traffic of the protein. We also conclude thatdexamethasone does not interfere with the genomic regulation of c-fos mRNAsynthesis.",17007911,17007911

Aminoguanidine (AG) is known as an effectiveantioxidant and its free radical scavenger effects may protect GEN-induced acuterenal failure (ARF). Therefore, this study was focused on investigating thepossible protective effect of AG against GEN-induced nephrotoxicity in an in vivorat model. We investigated the effects of AG on GEN-induced changes in renaltissue malondialdehyde (MDA) levels; nitric oxide (NO) generation; glutathioneperoxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities;glutathione (GSH) content; serum creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)levels. Morphological changes in the kidney were also examined using lightmicroscopy. GEN administration to control group rats increased renal MDA and NOlevels but decreased GSH-Px, SOD, CAT activities and GSH content. AGadministration with GEN injection resulted in significantly decreased MDA, NOgeneration and increased GSH-Px, SOD, CAT activities and GSH content whencompared with GEN alone. Serum levels of Cr and BUN significantly increased as aresult of nephrotoxicity. Also, AG significantly decreased Cr and BUN levels.Morphological changes in the kidney, including tubular necrosis, intracellularedema, glomerular and basement membrane alterations were evaluated qualitatively.Both biochemical findings and histopathological evidence showed thatadministration of AG reduced the GEN-induced kidney damage. We propose that AGacts in the kidney as a potent scavenger of free radicals to prevent the toxiceffects of GEN both at the biochemical and histological level.",16999986,16999986

Inthis context, we undertook an ultrastructural study on the periurethralconnective tissue with an emphasis on incontinent women with normotonic andhypotonic urethras. Small specimens of periurethral connective tissue wereobtained by dissection during a tension-free vaginal tape-implantation procedurein 34 stress urinary incontinent postmenopausal women with a normotonic urethraand 9 stress urinary incontinent postmenopausal women with a hypotonic urethra.In the samples taken from stress-incontinent women with a normotonic urethra,intact elastic fibers were closely connected with collagen fibers, smooth musclecells and fibrocytes. In the samples taken from stress-incontinent women with ahypotonic urethra, we detected irregular fragmented distribution of the elastinwithin the tissue. We assume that these structural changes lead to functionalconsequences, such as diminished tissue extensibility and loss of stabilitysurrounding the female urethra.

Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that AC is a poor fixativein preserving the general tissue and cellular organization. PFA, and to a lesserextent FA, produced significantly better results. Another set of cryosectionswere further analyzed to test the properties of those fixatives to preserveproteins from specific cell structures. Cytokeratin filaments, F-actin filamentsand nuclei were immunolabeled and examined using confocal microscopy. Resultsdemonstrated that, overall, PFA is the best fixative tested. However, FA fixationgave poor results in preserving neuronal tissues. Immunofluorescence confirmedthe inefficiency of AC fixation, after which no specific labelling of cytokeratinfilaments was detectable. Nevertheless, actin filaments were detectable onAC-fixed samples, a finding that was supported by the quantification offluorescein-phalloidin binding to F-actin. Overall, the data suggest that ACfixation is unacceptable for preservation of most samples, whereas FA and PFAfixation should be chosen according to the tissues and proteins to be studied.",16950501,16950501

The distinct CaM geneswere widely expressed throughout this region with moderate intensities. In spiteof the similar general pattern, significant differences in the distributions ofthe multiple CaM mRNA species were found in certain areas. In general, the CaMIII mRNAs were most abundant, followed by the CaM I and CaM II mRNA populations.Most of the transcripts were found in the neuronal somata comprising the medullarnuclei, while much less label was detected in the neuropil. The CaM III mRNAswere more than 2.5 times more abundant than the CaM II mRNAs in the nucleus ofthe trapezoid body, and more than two times more abundant in the motor trigeminalnucleus, the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus and the olivary nucleus. TheCaM III mRNAs were less dominant in the medial lemniscus, the inferior colliculusand the pontine reticular nucleus than those of the other CaM gene-specifictranscripts. The CaM mRNA levels were low to moderate, without significantdifferences, in the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus.

Itis generally accepted that Sertoli cells control the germ cell population throughone of the best-known apoptotic pathways, the Fas/Fas L paracrine signaltransduction system, in which a Fas ligand (Fas L) expressed by Sertoli cellsinduces apoptosis when it binds with its receptor, Fas, expressed by the germcells. Recently, we demonstrated the presence of Fas antigen in normal ejaculatedspermatozoa from fertile bulls and suggested that this molecule might have anon-apoptotic, defensive role against injuries, especially oxidative stress. Wehave now investigated whether bull mature, fertile spermatozoa express not onlythe Fas receptor but also its natural ligand Fas L. Our results indicate that thewhole sperm population expresses Fas L.

Ten cases of each tumor type and 10 cases ofmucous extravasation phenomenon (control) were examined using picrosirius redstaining and polarizing microscopy. In each case, at least 50 thin (approximately 0.8 microm) and 50 thick (1.6-2.4 microm) collagen fibers werecounted and classified as green-yellow or yellow-orange, the mean percentage wascalculated and statistical differences analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Results showeda similar thin fiber distribution in all tumor types and controls (82-88%green-yellow, 12-18% yellow-orange, p>0.05). Thick fibers showed a differentdistribution in polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma and adenoid cysticcarcinoma (approximately 50% green-yellow) compared to pleomorphic adenoma andmucous extravasation phenomenon (approximately 13% green-yellow) (p=0.001). Thickfiber distribution was similar in polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma andadenoid cystic carcinoma (p>0.05). We conclude that with picrosirius red stainingand polarizing microscopy, stromal collagen fibers differ significantly inpleomorphic adenoma from those in polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma andadenoid cystic carcinoma, but not from mucous extravasation phenomenon.Similarity between polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma and adenoid cysticcarcinoma may indicate that these tumor types represent a single entity with abroad spectrum of biological behavior.",16899283,16899283

Light microscopy revealed immunopositivity inboth parenchymal and meningeal vessels. In each transverse-sectioned vascularpair, one element was intensely labelled, and the adjacent one showed only slightor negligible reaction. Colloidal gold particles were restricted to endothelialcells, showing an asymmetric labelling pattern, which was always characterized bymarkedly higher density of immunolabelling of the abluminal rather than theluminal plasmalemma.

This study was designed toinvestigate the histophysiological effects of resuscitation with different plasmasubstitutes on the heart, lung and brain tissues following acute blood loss inmale Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-280g (n=30). After anesthesia with sodiumpentobarbital, the left femoral vein and artery were cannulated for theadministration of volume expanders and for direct measurement of arterialpressure and heart rate.

In order to address this problem, the shell of theterrestrial tortoise Testudo hermanni, the freshwater turtle Chrysemys picta, andthe soft shelled turtle Trionix spiniferus were studied. The study was carriedout using immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy and autoradiography followinginjection of tritiated histidine. The species used in the present studyillustrate three different types of shell growth that occur in chelonians. Inscutes of Testudo and Chrysemys, growth mainly occurs in the hinge regions by theproduction of cells that accumulate beta-keratin and incorporate tritiatedhistidine. Newly produced bundles of alpha- and beta-keratin incorporate most ofthe histidine. No keratohyalin is observed in the epidermis of any of the speciesstudied here. In Testudo, newly generated corneocytes containing beta-keratinform a corneous layer to form the growing rings of scutes. In Chrysemys, newlygenerated corneocytes containing beta-keratin form the new, expanded corneouslayer. In the latter species, at the end of the growing season (autumn/fall),thin corneocytes containing little beta-keratin are produced underneath thecorneous layer, and gradually form a scission layer. In the following growingseason (spring-summer) the shedding layer matures and determines the loss of theouter corneous layer. In this way, scutes expand their surface at any new molt.In Trionix, no distinct scutes and hinge regions are present and during thegrowing season, new corneocytes are mainly produced along the perimeter of theshell. Corneocytes of Trionix contain little beta-keratin and form a thickcorneous layer in which cells resemble the alpha-layer of the softer epidermis ofthe limbs, tail and neck. Neither keratohyalin nor specific histidineincorporation was observed in these cells. Corneocytes are gradually lost fromthe epidermal surface. Dermal scutes are absent in Trionix, but the dermis isorganized in 6-10 layers of plywood-patterned collagen bundles. The stratifiedlayers gradually disappear toward the growing border of the shell. The mode ofgrowth of horny scutes in these different species of chelonians is discussed.",16733064,16733064

We developed a listing of effective saccharide inhibitors ofimmobilized Con A based on 3901 replicates. We suggest that this is the mostextensive saccharide inhibitor list ever developed for this lectin and it may beuseful to use this listing to replace the less extensive lists that have been inthe literature for decades. Information is also provided on pH effects onimmobilized Con A binding based on 918 trials. Two assays to study binding, onewhich qualitatively scores more or less binding than control in thousands ofreplicate samples, and another that quantitatively evaluates binding by countingthe number of cells bound to each bead, are also modeled here. We know of noprevious studies that provide such extensive information on saccharide inhibitionand pH effects on the binding of immobilized Con A.

A total of 57 musclespindles from 26 cases were studied. The parameters determined were: the diameterand area of spindles, the number, diameter and area of intrafusal fibers, thenumber and area of nuclei. In addition, the ratio of the area of the intrafusalfibers to the area of nuclei and the ratio of the area of the spindle to the areaof the intrafusal fibers were calculated. Statistical evaluation of the datashowed significant differences regarding the area of the muscle spindle, thediameter of the intrafusal fibers and the mean area of nuclei of the intrafusalfibers, which were all smaller in patients than in controls (p=0.03, 0.01 and0.02, respectively), while the thickness of the capsule was greater in patientsthan in controls (p=0.01). Our results indicate that the muscle spindleparticipates in the pathological processes of Werdnig-Hoffmann disease.",16730053,16730053

Abnormal glycosylation of cell structures,including changes in sialylation, is a feature of the neoplastic transformationprocess. The aim of this study was to evaluate associations between neoplasticchanges in the thyroid gland and changes in sialylation, with reference to itsterminal linkage type. Lectin histochemistry using three sialic acid-bindinglectins: Tritrichomonas mobilensis lectin (TML), which recognizes sialic acidwithout linkage preference; Maackia amurensis leukoagglutinin (MAL), whichpreferentially binds alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid; and Sambucus nigra agglutinin(SNA), which preferentially binds alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid, were used fordetection of sialylated glycoconjugates in 50 human thyroid gland specimens.These included papillary, follicular, oncocytic, medullary and anaplasticcarcinomas, follicular adenomas and benign follicular and parenchymatous goiter.The luminal surface of follicular cells in normal thyroid glands, adenomas andgoiters showed weak or absent labelling for sialic acid. Malignant transformationof the gland was accompanied by an increase of sialic acid positivity onfollicular epithelial cells, especially of alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid. Strongluminal positivity for sialic acid was found in papillary carcinomas, whereasmoderate positivity was seen in follicular carcinomas. Inconsistent, weakpositivity for sialic acid was documented in medullary and anaplastic carcinomas.Increased membrane sialic acid on thyroid gland cells may be an importantdiagnostic pathological finding, that could be useful in distinction of malignantfrom benign thyroid lesions, especially with respect to aspiration cytologydiagnostics.",16720036,16720036

TSH-producingcells were labelled using a peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunohistochemicalprocedure for binding of a rabbit anti-rat beta-thyrotropic polyclonal antisera.Morphometric differences in the cytoplasmic and nuclear volume densities inthyrotropes after the treatments were determined using a stereological method.The relative weights of the pituitary glands were significantly higher in theEDP- and EDP+hCG-treated juvenile and peripubertal rats than in untreatedage-matched controls. Treatment with EDP promoted a decrease, and treatment withhCG an increase, of the cellular and nuclear volumes in TSH cells in bothjuvenile and peripubertal females in comparison with the respective controls.Treatment with a combination of EDP+hCG did not induce any significant changes.The cytoplasmic and nuclear volume densities in TSH cells in the EDP+hCG-treatedgroup were significantly higher than in the EDP-treated, and significantly lowerthan in hCG-treated rats at both growth stages. These findings suggest thatestradiol and hCG exerted opposite effects on pituitary TSH-immunoreactive cells.The observed effects on thyrotrope morphology were apparently independent of thestage of development.",16714054,16714054

Although elastic fibers can be visualizedusing several histochemical methods, the specificity and mechanism of bindinginvolved remain to be clarified. In this work, we compared the elastic net of theporcine pericardial matrix with that of the aortic wall using1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) and dansyl chloride (DCl) as fluorescentprobes and the permanganate-bisulfite-toluidine (PBT) method. Polarized light andfluorescence microscopy were simultaneously used to analyze the tissues. Somesamples also were examined using confocal microscopy. Aorta and pericardiumtreated with ANS and DCl showed elastic fibers and lamellae with an intense bluefluorescence. When stained with the PBT method, the aortic elastic lamellae wereclearly metachromatic and, under polarized light, they showed a greenishbirefringence.

These intermediate aggregates encompass nascentelements of amyloid structure and can act as seeds in PF formation. Takentogether with the observation that PFs often protrude from NFPs, our data suggestthat PFs form by a random nucleation mechanism in which the polypeptide chainssample many different aggregated conformations. Once the appropriate structuralcharacteristics are acquired, PFs are formed by addition of further polypeptidechains.",16714052,16714052

When using a less sensitive stainingmethod, some true positive cases of amyloidosis remain undetected. A more highlyspecific method potentially detects more cases and reveals amyloidosis in anearlier stage of deposition. In this paper, the Congo red staining methodaccording to Romhanyi is discussed in comparison with Puchtler's and Bennhold'smethods. Using Romhanyi's technique, there is no alcoholic differentiation, andthus no dye molecules are washed off the amyloid filaments. The binding of theoriented dye molecules is optimal for polarization microscopy. With this method,the polar hydrophilic mounting medium, gum Arabic is used. Mounted in thiscarbohydrate-containing, hydrophilic medium, the Congo red molecules are orientedparallel to the surface of the amyloid filaments and the sign is linear positive,corresponding to an additive character of topo-optical staining reactions.Otherwise, the Congo red molecules are oriented perpendicular to the surface ofcollagen, reducing the intensity of birefringence and even inducing an inversionof the original sign of the collagen birefringence. With alcoholicdifferentiation, Congo red dye molecules are extracted and this decreases thebirefringence of amyloid deposits, i.e. minimal amyloid deposits may be missed.Using the apolar hydrophobic mounting medium, Canada balsam, an axis-parallelarrangement of Congo red dye molecules on the surface of collagen fibers andamyloid will occur, resulting in an additive topo-optical reaction with a greenpolarization color and a false positive diagnosis of amyloidosis (""phantomamyloidosis"").",16714051,16714051

Experimental diabetes was induced by a single-dose (60 mg/kg,intraperitoneally (ip)) STZ injection, and melatonin was injected (200microg/kg/day, ip) for 4 weeks. Upon light and electron microscopic examination,we observed that melatonin improved the morphological and histopathologicalchanges of the liver caused by diabetes. Malondialdehyde levels in the liverhomogenates of UD rats were higher than those of controls and were markedlyreduced after melatonin treatment. Although no significant difference wasobserved with respect to antioxidant status, the superoxide dismutase activitytended to be higher in the UD rats than in the treated rats.

Patients with MM canfurthermore present with anemia, hypercalcemia and renal failure. Non-secretorymultiple myeloma (NSMM) is characterized by the absence of a monoclonal (M)protein in both the serum and urine. The reported incidence is 1-5% of allmultiple myeloma cases. Development of amyloid tumors in NSMM has been describedin the literature only occasionally. The clinical features of a 49-year-oldfemale patient with NSMM and amyloid tumors in the breast, lung and rib arepresented in this report. Conventional histology, Congo red staining with andwithout potassium permanganate pretreatment, aldehyde bisulfite-toluidine blue(ABT) reaction, sialic acid specific topo-optical reaction, toluidine bluetopo-optical reaction as well as immunohistochemistry were performed. An attemptis made to explain the lack of monoclonal immunoglobulins in the serum and urine,although extensive organ amyloidosis of AL type (kappa-light chains) has beenfound. It is assumed that the plasmocytic plasma cells possess an excretorymechanism, which allows the pathologic immunoglobulins to be secreted either asamyloid proteins polymerizing into amyloid fibrils, or as immunoglobulinfragments that are subject to degradation as soon as they are excreted out of thetumor cell.

One moleculeplaying a major role in these processes is the CD44 surface receptor, which isexpressed in a wide range of cells including many cells of the hemopoieticsystem, where it mediates the interaction with its major ligand, hyaluronate.However, little is known about CD44 and hyaluronate in bone marrow and this wasinvestigated immunohistochemically in trephine biopsies and in cultivated humanbone marrow stromal cells. In biopsy specimens, patches of hyaluronate depositionwere detected in the extracellular matrix (ECM). However, most of the areas ofthe ECM were devoid of hyaluronate. Single mast cells and lymphocytes scatteredthroughout the marrow were CD44 immunopositive. Marrow-derived stromal cells(MDSC) expanded in cell culture were immunopositive for CD44, hyaluronatesynthase, and hyaluronate. Hence, a marked difference between CD44immunolocalisation and hyaluronate deposition can be observed between in situ andunder cell culture conditions. Since in normal marrow in situ the number of CD44immunopositive cells was low, interactions of CD44 and hyaluronate would appearto not to play a major role in cell adhesion in the normal bone marrow.",16713618,16713618

Apoptotic cells in the uterus werelocalised using TUNEL and visualised with a FITC marker. There was a similarincrease in apoptosis in the uterine luminal epithelium in the PP(PE) andCCPP(PE) treated animals; no changes were observed in apoptosis in the otheruterine compartments when compared to the control. The CCPP(PE)-treated tissueshowed tall epithelial cells with long microvilli while the PP(PE) tissue hadshort microvilli and low cuboidal epithelium. These results suggest that CC doesnot disrupt the normal apoptotic activity seen at implantation, but does changethe morphology of the luminal epithelium, suggesting that these cellular changescould influence successful implantation.",16584758,16584758

The skin samples were fixed in 10% formalin for histology and 2.5%glutaraldehyde solution for electron microscopy and processed using routineprotocols. Histological sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E),Masson's trichrome and were also labelled for binding of a primary antibodyagainst collagen I using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method. The epidermalthicknesses were measured and the fibroblast count of the dermis was taken andthe results compared using the statistical ANOVA test. Semi-thin sections werestained with toluidine blue-azure II solution and ultrathin sections werecontrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Histochemical andimmunohistochemical observations demonstrated that AHA treatment resulted instatistically significant increased thickness of the epidermis and an increase innumbers of active fibroblasts and in the amount of dense collagen, especially athigher dosages of AHA. Ultrastructural examination of rat skin from AHA-treatedgroups showed cytoplasmic vacuolization in epidermal keratinocytes, intercellulardysjunctions, and increased quantities of organized bundles of collagen fibers inthe dermis. The use of AHA in appropriate dosages has been found to play animportant role in the treatment of specific skin disorders, however, the harmfuleffects of use of AHAs at higher concentrations should not be ignored. Weconclude that alpha hydroxyl acids have a wide spectrum of use in the field ofdermatology but, due to side-effects, their use, dosage, and time frame should berestricted to the advice of dermatologists.",16574202,16574202

Apoptosis isa frequent event in the anterior pituitary in which unwanted cells are eliminatedwithout affecting neighboring cells. We examined the link between apoptosis andthe occurrence of colloids in the guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) pituitary glandand the relationship of clusterin accumulation in the colloids. S-100 positivefolliculostellate (FS) cells were found surrounding colloids. Apoptotic cellsdetected by single stranded DNA (ssDNA) immunohistochemistry were observed in thewhole anterior pituitary and preferentially near colloid masses. Clusterinprotein was detected in endocrine cells, FS cells and in the colloids. In situhybridization showed clusterin mRNA in endocrine cells and FS cells. Simultaneouslocalization was performed to determine whether clusterin mRNA and ssDNA withinanterior pituitary was present within the same cell. Clusterin mRNA was notdetected in apoptotic cells but was present in neighboring surviving cells. Atthe ultrastructural level, numerous endocrine cells at different stages ofapoptosis were found phagocytosed by FS cells. Our results suggest that clusterinis produced by endocrine cells for cytoprotection before death. Apoptoticendocrine cells are phagocytosed by FS cells and digested by their lysosomalenzymes. In FS cells, clusterin interacts and aggregates with by-products ofdigestion that subsequently become stored in colloid as a residual body.",16569423,16569423

In this study, we investigated whetherselective sarcoplasmic and mitochondrial KATP channel blockers affectedmyocardial apoptosis and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in a rat model ofmyocardial ischemia/reperfusion in vitro. Isolated rat hearts were subjected to30 min of coronary artery occlusion followed by 30 min of reperfusion. Aselective sarcKATP channel blocker, HMR1098 and a selective mitoKATP channelblocker, 5-hydroxydecanoate, were added to the perfusion fluid 10 min beforeocclusion. Myocardial apoptosis was detected immunohistochemically using theTUNEL method. Myocardial inducible NOS (iNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) weredetermined immunohistochemically. In control hearts, apoptosis induction wasassociated with a greater immunoreactivity of iNOS than eNOS. Treatment withHMR1098, at a concentration of 3 micromol/l, significantly reduced theTUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes and this was associated with decreased iNOS andincreased eNOS immunoreactivity. When this drug was administered at a higherconcentration, at 30 micromol/l, a more marked reduction in apoptosis wasobserved but, in contrast to the effects observed at the lower drugconcentration, eNOS immunoreactivity was almost completely abolished while iNOSwas strong. Moreover, ischemia-induced cardiac dysfunction (e.g. contractileforce and recovery of coronary flow) was increased by the higher concentration ofHMR 1098. In hearts treated with 5-hydroxydecanoate, myocyte apoptosis wasslightly reduced, and this was associated with an almost equal increase in bothiNOS and eNOS immunoreactivity. These findings suggest that iNOS appears to bemore important than eNOS in the reduction of apoptosis. However, the furtherinhibition of apoptosis by the higher concentration of HMR 1098 was associatedwith poorer cardiac function.",16566960,16566960

Similarly,interleukin-6 (IL-6) is increased 2.4-fold in endometriosis and 4.4-fold inendometrial adenocarcinoma. These proteins appear to be involved in theprogression of both these conditions. GH is particularly interesting in thiscontext since it is known to not only promote cellular proliferation but alsoreduces cell-cell adhesion, thus allowing individual cells to break away fromtheir parent architecture.

Identification of differentiation markersduring transformation of stromal cells into osteoblasts in a time-dependentmanner may be informative for cell-based tissue engineering. Therefore, weinvestigated the effects of osteogenic medium (OM) on the proliferation anddifferentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). BMSCs from adult malerat tibia and femur were collected and cultured in alpha-MEM medium with 10%fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin and gentamycin. After three days ofculture, the medium covering the adherent cells in culture was changed to OMcontaining dexamethasone, Na-beta-glycerophosphate and ascorbic acid. As acontrol, cell culture was also continued in the original medium for the same timeperiod. Differentiated osteoblast cells were collected after 7, 10, 14, 21 and 30days of culture, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and their immunolabelling forosteoblast markers osteonectin (ON) and osteocalcin (OC) was assessed using anindirect immunoperoxidase technique. Immunolabelling of ON and OC was detectablefrom day 10 of culture, began to increase on day 14, and increased steadilythrough to day 21. Labelling was highest on day 30 and was more intense in cellscultured with OM compared to the culture without OM. The control cells culturedin the absence of OM produced negligible levels of both markers. In conclusion,our culture system facilitated differentiation of BMSCs into osteoblastsfeaturing osteoblast markers, and these cells may be useful in autologous boneimplant for the treatment of bone wound healing.",16443258,16443258

Wedetected similar high deposition of the studied ECM proteins and their receptorsin the stroma of primary tumors and in liver metastases and a lower deposition inlymph node metastases. Cytoplasmic immune reaction for FN and TN was also seen inthe tumor cells. A pronounced co-localization of immune deposits for FN and TNand their receptors was found in the stroma of the center and the invasion front(IF) (p<0.0001). A significant decrease of FN immune signal was observed in theIF in primary tumors and liver metastases (p<0.0001). The levels ofimmunolabeling of FN and TN correlated with the differentiation grade of primarytumors (p<0.0001).

For inhibin-betaB, the most intenselabelling was noted in atypical hyperplasia compared to EC (p<0.05). A strongcolocalisation of inhibin-alpha and -betaA could be demonstrated in malignantendometrial tissue, suggesting the production of inhibin A within the tumour.Additionally, only limited colocalisation of inhibin-betaB with -alpha subunitcould be observed, suggesting the synthesis of activin B rather than inhibin B inmalignant endometrium. In conclusion, INH-betaA and -betaB were labelled innormal, hyperplastic and malignant endometrium.

Quantitativedifferences of immunofluorescence labelling for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan(CSPG), fibronectin (FN), tenascin-C (TN-C), and thrombospondin (TSP) wereevaluated in intact rat dorsal and ventral roots and dorsal and ventral roots 2and 4 weeks after rhizotomy using image analysis. The distal stumps of spinalroots displayed increased immunolabelling for the molecules with higherimmunofluorescence in dorsal than in ventral roots up to 2 weeks fromtransection. Four weeks after rhizotomy, the immunoreactivity for CSPG, TN-C andTSP decreased in dorsal and increased in ventral root stumps, although a higherlevel of immunofluorescence for FN remained in both dorsal and ventral rootstumps 4 weeks after injury in comparison to 2 weeks after injury. We suggestthat the amount of some ECM molecules changed differentially 2 and 4 weeks afterrhizotomy to create an appropriate environment in the endoneurium for early andlater regrowth of sensory and motor axons. The results presented here are thefirst report of differences between the endoneurial ECM content of damagedafferent and motor nerve fibers. In addition, the immunohistochemical detectionof individual ECM molecules indicated that final extrinsic conditions stimulatingthe regrowth of regenerating axons probably arise from a balance of bothgrowth-promoting and -inhibiting molecules in the endoneurium.",16414104,16414104

Most recently, we have used this assay to examine lectinbinding ligands on two human cell types, CCL-220, a colon cancer cell line, andCRL-1459, a non-cancer colon cell line. We found that CCL-220 cells boundspecific lectins better than CRL-1459, and this information was used to test forpossible differential toxicity of these lectins in culture, as a possibleapproach in the design of more specific anti-cancer drugs. Although we haveexamined the validity of the bead-binding assay in sea urchin cell systems, wehave not previously validated this technique for mammalian cells. Here thebinding results of the bead assay are compared with conventional fluorescenceassays, using lectins from three species (Triticum vulgaris, Phaseolus vulgaris,and Lens culinaris) on the two colon cell lines. These lectins were chosenbecause they seemed to interact with the two cell lines differently. Bindingresults obtained using both assays were compared for frozen, thawed and fixed;cultured and fixed; and live cells. Both qualitative and quantitativefluorescence results generally correlated with those using the bead assay.Similar results were also obtained with all of the three different cellpreparation protocols. The fluorescence assay was able to detect lower lectinbinding ligand levels than the bead assay, while the bead assay, because it canso rapidly detect cells with large numbers of lectin binding ligands, is idealfor initial screening studies that seek to identify cells that are rich insurface binders for specific molecules. The direct use of frozen, thawed andfixed cells allows rapid mass screening for surface molecules, without therequirement for costly and time consuming cell culture.",16414103,16414103

This system in the testis is believed to bea paracrine signaling system by which Sertoli cells expressing Fas L can initiatekilling of Fas-expressing germ cells during spermatogenesis. So far, the presenceof Fas antigen in ejaculated spermatozoa was related only to subfertility orinfertility conditions. We demonstrated for the first time that normal ejaculatedspermatozoa also express Fas antigen. Our data showed that a large percentage ofnormal ejaculated spermatozoa of fertile bulls are immunocytochemically positivefor Fas. Our observations provide further evidence of the ""regionalization"" ofsperm membrane antigens. Furthermore, we suggest that in mature fertileejaculated spermatozoa the Fas antigen may also provide resistance to programmedcell death, like in some other cells expressing molecules that inhibit thesignals induced by Fas or the death program itself. In addition, we suggest thatFas antigen can partly protect the spermatozoa against apoptosis induced bylipoperoxidative damage that can occur spontaneously in the male gamete atvarious stages in its lifetime.",16330085,16330085

The presence ofneuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in Leydig cells is related to its role inthe regulation of testosterone release. Varicocele is often characterized byabnormal sperm quality and influences the fertilizing capacity of the haploidgamete. We investigated the localization of NGF and nNOS in testes of adultWistar rats with experimentally induced varicocele after 9, 11, and 13 weeks, aswell as in sham-operated controls by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Incontrol testis, we detected NGF in nuclei of Sertoli cells and also as smallvesicular-like structures in the cytoplasm of primary spermatocytes, and in roundand elongating spermatids. Varicocele-induction revealed a slight decrease of NGFat 13 weeks, especially in Sertoli cells. In control tissue, nNOS protein waspresent mainly in Leydig cells and in Sertoli cell cytoplasm. Additionally, nNOSimmunoreactivity was present in the heads of elongated spermatids. Western blotresults revealed that the decrease of NGF was not significant in the 13-weekvaricocele group, moreover, the amount of nNOS was not altered in any of thevaricocele groups. In conclusion, NGF and nNOS have important roles for normalgametogenesis and our data for the first time indicates that varicocele inductiondoes not necessarily affect the expression of NGF and nNOS. Thus, these twomolecules do not appear to be related to varicocele induction.",16325891,16325891

Lymph node biopsy tissue was fixed in bufferedformaldehyde, routinely processed to paraffin wax blocks, cut into 4-microm-thicksections, stained with hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemically labelledusing a triple-layer APAAP protocol with purified polyclonal antibodies directedagainst SP 70 and SP90 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and monoclonal antibodiesagainst CD22, CD4, CD8, CD56, and CD68. Intensity of immunolabelling was assessedsemiquantitatively by two independent observers. An increased CD4:CD8 ratio,moderate increase of immunolabelling for CD68 and slight decrease inimmunolabelling for CD20, CD56, and SP90 was indicative of PSH when compared withRSH. The most notable difference between the studied groups was a difference inimmunoreactivity to SP70 and CD4 antibodies.

Ito cells were detected by goldchloride impregnation, as well as desmin and alpha-smooth muscle actin(alpha-SMA) immunohistochemistry. Additionally, all groups were examinedultrastructurally. The number of Ito cells that were labelled positively withgold impregnation decreased in the fibrotic groups; however, alpha-SMA and desminimmunopositive Ito cells increased. The samples from animals that were treatedwith vitamin A showed an increase in labelling with gold impregnation but adecrease in alpha-SMA immunopositivity. The data showed that vitamin A canprevent hepatic injury, by suppressing the transformation of Ito cells tofibrogenic form.

A totalof 18 male rats were separated into three groups of six rats each: (1)sham-operated animals served as controls; (2) a PBOO group, without furthertreatment (3) and a group that immediately after PBOO, received treatment for 4weeks with oral Celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor. Uroepithelial celljunctions were evaluated using transmission electron microscopy combined withmorphometry. Results were also assessed by E-cadherin and alpha-cateninimmunohistochemistry. Morphometrical analysis of ultrastructural evaluationsrevealed that 4 weeks of PBOO caused a significant reduction in the electrondensity of zonula adherens and zonula occludens junctional complexes. Moreover,some desmosomes located between the deeper cells of the uroepithelium showedsigns of disintegration. Selective COX-2 inhibitor treatment during 4 weeks ofPBOO showed protective effects on adherens and occludens junctions, as well as ondesmosomes. Immunohistochemical analysis of E-cadherin confirmed that thedecreased E-cadherin immunolabelling in 4 weeks of PBOO was prevented byselective COX-2 inhibitor treatment. Based on ultrastructural morphometricalanalysis, we conclude that PBOO alone and in combination with selective COX-2inhibitors can have considerable effects on uroepithelial cellular junctions.

The pathogenesis of cardiovasculardisease (CVD) in diabetes is multifactorial and can be affected by metabolic andother factors. A hypothesis for the initial lesion of atherosclerosis isendothelial dysfunction, defined pragmatically as changes in the concentration ofthe chemical messengers produced by the endothelial cell and/or by blunting ofthe nitric oxide-dependent vasodilatory response to acetylcholine or hyperemia.Endothelial dysfunction has been documented in patients with diabetes and inindividuals with insulin resistance or at high risk for developing type 2diabetes. The way endothelial function altered in diabetic patients is not yetfully understood, but the loss of normal endothelial function could be involvedin the pathogenesis of diabetic angiopathy, as endothelial dysfunction isassociated with diabetic microangiopathy and macroangiopathy. Factors associatedwith endothelial dysfunction in diabetes include activation of protein kinase C,overexpression of growth factors and/or cytokines, and oxidative stress. Changesin endothelium function may lead to the coronary artery circulation being unableto cope with the increased metabolism of myocardial muscle independently of areduced coronary artery diameter.

Patientswere divided into two groups as cases with local and stable lesions (Group i, n:20) and severe cases with extensive involvement (Group ii, n: 18).

In a subgroup of females the use oforal contraceptives (p = 0.13) or a positive history of thromboembolism (p =0.21) were not identified as important risk factors. CONCLUSION:Echocardiographic detection of asymptomatic thrombotic complications contributedto the higher percentage of these complications in our study. Although we canidentify the risk factor (laboratory or clinical) in a majority of patients witha thromboembolic complication, occurrence of these complications isunpredictable.",16696443,16696443
