================

Large parts of this manual originate from Travis E. Oliphant's book
`Guide to Numpy <http://www.tramy.us/>`__ (which generously entered
Public Domain in August 2008). The reference documentation for many of
the functions are written by numerous contributors and developers of
Numpy, both prior to and during the
`Numpy Documentation Marathon <http://scipy.org/Developer_Zone/DocMarathon2008>`__.

The Documentation Marathon is still ongoing. Please help us write
better documentation for Numpy by joining it! Instructions on how to
join and what to do can be found
`on the scipy.org website <http://scipy.org/Developer_Zone/DocMarathon2008>`__
