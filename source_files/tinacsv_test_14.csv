Results revealed that motorcyclistfatalities and injuries are strongly associated with normalized heating degreedays and precipitation inches, and that universal helmet laws are associated withlower motorcyclist fatality rates when these climate measures, and theirinteraction, are statistically controlled. This study shows that climate measureshave considerable promise as indirect measures (proxies) of motorcycling activityin generalized linear regression studies.",16202466,16202466,,

This paperdescribes and evaluates an innovative court-based intervention for repeat impaired-driving offenders, the driving under the influence (DUI) IntensiveSupervision Program (DISP) developed in Multnomah County, Oregon. METHODS: Thehazard of re-offending was compared between DISP participants (N=460) and acomparison group (N=497). The stratified Cox proportional hazards model was usedto model the hazard of re-offense, adjusting for matching criteria and stratifiedby county of residence. RESULTS: Adjusted hazard of DUI re-offense for DISPparticipants was 0.52 that of comparison offenders (95% CI=0.36-0.76). DISPclients also had lower arrest rates for driving while revoked/suspended and forall other traffic offenses. CONCLUSION: Preliminary results suggest the DISP isan effective means of reducing recidivism among repeat impaired-drivingoffenders.",16202465,16202465,,
"1","16198299","Title of a document in period '1'","Tay R","The purpose of this paper is to address two important issues regarding ageingdrivers. First, there is a presumption in the road safety arena that the expected increase in the number of ageing drivers on the roads will lead to an increase incrashes. Second, despite extensive research on ageing drivers, especially ontheir increased vulnerability and reduced driving abilities, the most widelyrecommended road safety strategy relates to the control of their drivinglicenses. This presumption and the associated policy recommendation are basedmainly on the higher relative crash risks associated with ageing drivers comparedto their younger counterparts. This study, however, argues that the average crashrisks obtained in previous studies provide only indirect information concerningthese issues and any decision based on these results may produce unexpectedoutcomes. An analytical framework to examine the marginal effect of changing thedriver mix on the roads is proposed and a simple empirical model is estimated asan illustration. In contrast to previous studies, we found that increasing thenumber of licenses issued to ageing drivers had only an insignificant impact onthe number of fatal crashes on the roads, suggesting that the concern over ageingdrivers may be a storm in a teacup.","16198299","16198299",,
"1","16197912","Title of a document in period '1'","Boyle LN","A logistic regression model was used in the prediction of injury severity forindividuals who are involved in a vehicular crash. The model identified females and older occupants (segmented by age 55-74, and 75 and older) as having a significantly higher risk of severe injuries in a crash. Further, interactions ofolder females with other factors, such as occupant seat position, crash type, and environmental factors were also shown to significantly impact the relative risk of a severe injury. This study revealed that females 75 years and older had the lowest odds of injury among all female occupants studied (OR=1.16) while females between 55 and 74 years old have higher risk of severe injuries (OR=1.74). All older females (55 and older) were at greater risk for head-on, side-impact andrear-end collisions. Seat belt use reduced severe injuries for females in this age group, but not to the same extent as the rest of the population studied.Additionally, crashes in severe weather, which were less likely to result in severe injuries for the general population, increased the risk of severe injuries to females that were 55 and older. Among occupants of light trucks, sport utility vehicles and vans, older females were less likely than others to be severely injured. In this case, older females appear better off in vehicles which are larger and protect better in severe crashes. This research demonstrates that circumstances surrounding a crash greatly impact the severity of injuries sustained by older female occupants.",16197912,16197912,,
"1","16191426","Title of a document in period '1'","Yannis G","A theoretical two-dimensional model on prevalence and risk was developed. Theobjective of this study was to validate this model empirically to answer three questions: How do European drivers perceive the importance of several causes of road accidents? Are there important differences in perceptions between member states? Do these perceptions reflect the real significance of road accidentcauses? Data were collected from 23 countries, based on representative national samples of at least 1000 respondents each (n=24,372). Face-to-face interviews with fully licensed, active car drivers were conducted using a questionnaire containing closed answer questions. Respondents were asked to rate 15 causes ofroad accidents, each using a six-point ordinal scale. The answers were analyzed by calculating Kendall's tau for each pair of items to form lower triangle similarity matrices per country and for Europe as a whole. These matrices were then used as the input files for an individual difference scaling to draw a perceptual map of the 15 items involved. The hypothesized model on risk and prevalence fits the data well and enabled us to answer the three questions of concern. The subject space of the model showed that there are no relevant differences between the 23 countries. The group space of the model comprises four quadrants, each containing several items (high perceived risk/low perceived prevalence items; high perceived risk/high perceived prevalence items; low perceived risk/high perceived prevalence items and low perceived risk/low perceived prevalence items). Finally, perceptions of the items driving under the influence of alcohol, drugs and medicines and driving using a handheld or hands-free mobile phone are discussed with regard to their real significance in causing road accidents. To conclude, individual difference scaling offers some promising possibilities to study drivers' perception of road accident causes.",16191426,16191426,,

METHODS:The study uses 1992-2002 data on motor vehicle fatalities among 15-17-year-old drivers from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System to identify the effects of""good"", ""fair"", and ""marginal"" GDL programs based upon designations by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Analysis is conducted using conditional negative binomial regressions with fixed effects. RESULTS: ""Good"" programs reduce total fatalities among young drivers by 19.4% (c.i. -33.0%, -5.9%). ""Fair"" programs reduce night-time young driver fatalities by 12.6% (c.i. -23.9%, -1.2%),but have no effect on day-time fatalities. ""Marginal"" programs had no statistically meaningful effect on driver fatalities. All three types of programs reduced teen passenger fatalities, but the effects of limitations on the number of passengers appear to have had only minimal effects in reducing fatalities among young drivers themselves. CONCLUSIONS: Stronger GDL programs are more effective than weaker programs in reducing teenage motor vehicle fatalities.",16171767,16171767,,
"1","16169506","Title of a document in period '1'","Compton C","PURPOSE: This study evaluated the cross-border safety impact of extended drinking hours from 1:00 to 2:00 a.m., in licensed establishments in Ontario, Canada.METHODS: This study examined patterns in total and alcohol-related casualties in:(1) Windsor, Ontario, Canada compared to Detroit, Michigan, US with a 2:00 a.m.closing time, and (2) Ontario compared to Michigan for overall trends. The criterion outcome indicators were: (1) monthly motor vehicle casualties (major injuries and fatalities) for the city-regions of Windsor and Detroit and (2)Ontario and Michigan monthly motor vehicle fatalities occurring between 11:00p.m. and 3:00 a.m. for 4 years pre- and 3 years post-policy change. In order to examine cross-border drinking consequences, data were disaggregated to assess trends of motor vehicle injury collisions involving vehicles with US licence plates and with US drivers aged 16-20 in the Windsor region; similarly trends were assessed for motor vehicle injury collisions involving vehicles with Ontario licence plates in the Detroit region. RESULTS: The Windsor region total motor vehicle casualty data showed a non-significant pre-post increase, while the Detroit region showed a statistically significant decrease for total motorvehicle casualties. In the Windsor region, a significant increase was found for alcohol-related motor vehicle casualties after the drinking hours were extended.However, the Detroit region showed a statistically significant decrease inalcohol-related motor vehicle casualties concomitant with Ontario's drinking hour extension. No similar trends were found for the province of Ontario and the state of Michigan as a whole. Moreover, a significant decrease was found for injury collisions involving vehicles with Ontario licence plates in the Detroit region but no similar pattern was found for injury collisions involving vehicles with US licence plates and with 16-20-year-old US drivers in the Windsor region.DISCUSSION: These data seem to support a cross-border impact of the Ontario extended drinking policy. A significant increase in alcohol-related motor vehicle casualties was found in the Windsor region and concomitantly, significant decreases in total and alcohol-related motor vehicle casualties were found in the Detroit region after the extended drinking hours amendment. The Ontario government's belief that the extended drinking hour policy would ""reduce the number of patrons who cross the border when Ontario's bars and restaurants close""may have been realized.",16169506,16169506,,
"1","16162331","Title of a document in period '1'","Pihlajamaki H","OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence, trends and nature of hospitalisation for injuries among Finnish conscripts between 1990 and 1999. STUDY DESIGN ANDSETTING: A hospital discharge register study on the hospitalisation for injuries with a follow-up of 213509-person-years. RESULTS: During the 10-year study period, altogether 20016 hospitalisations for injuries were registered. Over this period, the annual incidence of hospitalisation for injuries declined with 26%,from 113.3 (95% CI: 108.7-118.0) per 1000 conscripts in 1990 to 84.1 (95% CI:80.0-88.2) in 1999. Summer and autumn were the seasons with the highest incidence rates. Half of the injuries were sprains, strains, or fractures, and in half ofthe injuries, the anatomical location involved was the lower limb. The leading external causes of injuries were falls (31.8%) and injuries inflicted by foreign objects or machinery (18.5%). CONCLUSION: Although hospitalisations for injuries declined between 1990 and 1999, injuries are still an important cause of morbidity in the Finnish Defence Forces. Further studies to evaluate the risk factors and mechanisms of injuries are needed to develop effective prevention strategies.",16162331,16162331,,
"1","16157285","Title of a document in period '1'","Christens PF","A substantial body of research has shown that use of mobile phones while drivingcan impair driving performance and increase the risk of being involved in accidents. Similarly, mobile phone use seems to be an increasing activity thusrepresenting a relevant traffic safety issue. This paper investigates the extentand variations in mobile phone use among drivers of heavy vehicles in Denmark.The data was collected through written questionnaires and had a response rate of58%. It was found that more than 99% of the drivers used mobile phones whiledriving. Despite a prohibition of hand-held mobile phone use while driving 31% ofthe drivers reported to do so. Analysis of the variations in usage found apositive significant relationship between driving hours and phone use. A negativelinear effect was found between age and phone use. Similarly, a positivesignificant association was found between the number of stops and the amount ofphone use. 0.5% reported that their use of mobile phones had contributed to anaccident, while 6% had experienced their mobile phone use causing a dangeroussituation. However, 66% reported experiencing dangerous situations because ofothers road users' mobile phone use. Various implications of the findings arediscussed particularly in relation to the drivers with high exposure.",16157285,16157285,,

Using police report data (1997-2002, inclusive), average annual motor vehicle crash hospitalization and death rates among those 0-19 years of age were calculated for rural and urban regions. Across all age and sex strata examined, both the hospitalization and the fatality rates were significantly higher in rural compared with urban regions. After adjusting for age, sex andcalendar year, the relative risk of a motor vehicle crash hospitalization (ruralversus urban) was 3.0 (95% CI: 2.8, 3.2). After adjusting for age, sex and calendar year, the relative risk of a motor vehicle crash fatality was 5.4 (95%CI: 4.2, 6.9). Motor vehicle crash injury hospitalization and fatality rates among children and youth in the province of Alberta are considerably higher in rural areas compared with urban areas. There is a need to identify social,demographic and environmental driving hazards associated with the rural environment.",16139232,16139232,,
"1","16129405","Title of a document in period '1'","Ruff T","A radar-based proximity warning system was evaluated by researchers at the Spokane Research Laboratory of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to determine if the system would be effective in detecting objects in theblind spots of an off-highway dump truck. An average of five fatalities occureach year in surface mines as a result of an equipment operator not being awareof a smaller vehicle, person or change in terrain near the equipment. Sensor technology that can detect such obstacles and that also is designed for surface mining applications is rare. Researchers worked closely with the radar system manufacturer to test and modify the system on large, off-highway dump trucks at a surface mine over a period of 2 years. The final system was thoroughly evaluated by recording video images from a camera on the rear of the truck and by recording all alarms from the rear-mounted radar. Data show that the system reliably detected small vehicles, berms, people and other equipment. However, alarms from objects that posed no immediate danger were common, supporting the assertion that sensor-based systems for proximity warning should be used in combination with other devices, such as cameras, that would allow the operator to check the sourceof any alarm.",16129405,16129405,,
"1","16126153","Title of a document in period '1'","Laumon B","Road crashes have an unquestionably hierarchical crash-car-occupant structure.Multilevel models are used with correlated data, but their application to crash data can be difficult. The number of sub-clusters per cluster is small, with less than two cars per crash and less than two occupants per car, whereas the number of clusters can be high, with several hundred/thousand crashes. Application ofthe Monte-Carlo method on observed and simulated French road crash data between 1996 and 2000 allows comparing estimations produced by multilevel logistic models(MLM), Generalized Estimating Equation models (GEE) and logistic models (LM). Onthe strength of a bias study, MLM is the most efficient model while both GEE and LM underestimate parameters and confidence intervals. MLM is used as a marginal model and not as a random-effect model, i.e. only fixed effects are taken into account. Random effects allow adjusting risks on the hierarchical structure,conferring an interpretative advantage to MLM over GEE. Nevertheless, great careis needed for data coding and quite a high number of crashes are necessary in order to avoid problems and errors with estimates and estimate processes. On balance, MLM must be used when the number of vehicles per crash or the number of occupants per vehicle is high, when the LM results are questionable because they are not in line with the literature or finally when the p-values associated to risk measures are close to 5%. In other cases, LM remains a practical analytical tool for modelling crash data.",16126153,16126153,,
