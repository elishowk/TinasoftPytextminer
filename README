Thanks for using Tinasoft-Pytextminer

Pytextminer is a part of a larger software : Tinasoft Desktop you can find @ http://github.com/jbilcke/tinasoft.desktop/

A text-mining python module producing bottom-up ngram detection and mapping. Using NLTK the natural language processing toolkit (http://www.nltk.org/), bsddb the Berkeley embeddable DB connector for storage (http://www.jcea.es/programacion/pybsddb_doc/), and whoosh the indexation engine (http://whoosh.ca), it provides :
- document/corpus/ngram graphs database
- part-of-speech tagging
- nlp based tokenizer
- multiple stopwords sources support
- document text indexation
- co-occurrences matrix processing
- customizable graph generator (GEXF format)
- and soon a stemmer and a lemmatizer

SUPPORT AND FEEDBACK

INSTALL

    PYTHON : you'll need Python 2.6 interpreter : http://python.org/

    TinasoftPytextminer python package
        $ sudo python setup.py install
        or
        $ sudo python setup.py develop
    Dependencies will be checked : numpy, nltk, twisted, etc (see setup.py)

    NLTK DATA

    You'll need to install manually required nltk corpus data
        $ export NLTK_DATA="/path/to/TinasoftPytextminer/shared/nltk_data"
        $ python
        > import nltk.download()
        Downloader> d punkt
        Downloader> d brown
        Downloader> d conll2000

CONFIGURATION

    config.yaml is a YAML configuration files. It is searched by the main application object (TinaApp class) at the into the same source directory

    DEPRECATED :
[[[[[[[[[[
    declare each column name of your csv file into the corresponding field name of the configuration file, otherwise they will be ignored by the software

        titleField: document title
        contentField: document content
        authorField: document acronyme
        corpusNumberField: corpus number
        docNumberField: document number
        # the next columns are optional
        index1Field: document index 1
        index2Field: document index 2
        dateField: document publication date
        keywordsField: document keywords
]]]]]]]]]]
    check out the format of your csv file (encoding, delimiter, quoting character) and write them into fields "locale", "delimiter", "quotechar"
    "minSize", and "maxSize" means the length of n-grams extracted
    all other fields are the script configuration, or the default values for testing purpose

    WARNING : in YAML all tabulations are spaces, all string values must be quoted (eg : 'prop_title'). Further information at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML

USAGE

    - you can launch the http server to acces the API
    $ python tinaserver.py
    or executing tinaserver.exe under windows
    - you can try multiple features using code from the tests scripts into 'tests/'

SUPPORTED OPERATING SYSTEMS

    PyTextMiner was tested on the following Linux platforms:

        Linux 64 bits (AMD64, i686) with Python 2.6
        Windows XP SP2 and SP3 (32bit)
