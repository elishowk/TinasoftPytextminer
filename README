Thanks for using Tinasoft-Pytextminer

Pytextminer is a part of a larger software : Tinasoft Desktop you can find @ http://github.com/jbilcke/tinasoft.desktop/

A text-mining python module producing bottom-up ngram detection and mapping. Using NLTK the natural language processing toolkit (http://www.nltk.org/), bsddb the Berkeley embeddable DB connector for storage (http://www.jcea.es/programacion/pybsddb_doc/), and whoosh the indexation engine (http://whoosh.ca), it provides :
- document/corpus/ngram graphs database
- part-of-speech tagging
- nlp based tokenizer
- multiple stopwords sources support
- document text indexation
- co-occurrences matrix processing
- customizable graph generator (GEXF format)
- and soon a stemmer and a lemmatizer

INSTALL

    First of all, you'll need Python 2.6 interpreter : http://python.org/
    Then, install PyTextMiner's dependencies of the following source packages typing:
        $ sudo python setup.py install
        or
        $ sudo python setup.py develop
    Dependencies will be checked : numpy, nltk, tinasoft.data (for data storage)

CONFIGURATION

    config.yaml and import.yaml YAML configuration files. The first is used by the global application object (the TinaApp class) , the second is only used by the file importer specifying the file contents and NLP parameters

    import.yaml :

    declare each column name of your csv file into the corresponding field name of the configuration file, otherwise they will be ignored by the software

        titleField: document title
        contentField: document content
        authorField: document acronyme
        corpusNumberField: corpus number
        docNumberField: document number
        # the next columns are optional
        index1Field: document index 1
        index2Field: document index 2
        dateField: document publication date
        keywordsField: document keywords

    check out the format of your csv file (encoding, delimiter, quoting character) and write them into fields "locale", "delimiter", "quotechar"
    "minSize", and "maxSize" means the length of n-grams extracted
    all other fields are the script configuration, or the default values for testing purpose

    WARNING : in YAML all tabulations are spaces, all string values must be quoted (eg : 'prop_title'). Further information at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML

USAGE

    you can try multiple features using code from the tests scripts into 'tests/'

TESTED PLATFORMS

    PyTextMiner was tested on the following Linux platforms:

        Linux 64 bits (AMD64) with Python 2.5
        Linux 64 bits (AMD64) with Python 2.6

        Linux 32 bits (i686) with Python 2.5
        Linux 32 bits (i686) with Python 2.6

    PyTextMiner was also tested on MS-Windows with Python 2.6
