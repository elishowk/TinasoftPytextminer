PyTextMiner version 0.4

A simple text miner for CoWord analysis for Python 2.6

INSTALL

	For all platforms, local installs are the best way to get the job done
	First, you need a Python 2.6 interpreter : http://python.org/
	Then, install PyTextMiner's dependencies of the following source packages typing:
		$ sudo python setup.py install
		from each of the following directories:
			PyTextMiner/src/numpy/
			PyTextMiner/src/pysqlite/
			PyTextMiner/src/simplejson/

CONFIGURATION

	config.yaml is YAML

	declare each column name of your csv file into the corresponding field name of the configuration file, otherwise they will be ignored by the software

		titleField: document title
		contentField: document content
		authorField: document acronyme
		corpusNumberField: corpus number
		docNumberField: document number
		index1Field: document index 1
		index2Field: document index 2
		dateStartField: corpus start date
		dateEndField: corpus end date
		dateField: document publication date
		keywordsField: document keywords

	check out the format of your csv file (encoding, delimiter, quoting character) and write them into fields "locale", "delimiter", "quotechar"
	"minSize", and "maxSize" means the length of n-grams extracted
	all other fields are the script configuration, or the default values for testing purpose

	WARNING : config.yaml is written in YAML format, as a consequence all tabulations are spaces, all string values must be quoted (eg : 'prop_title'). Further information at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML

USAGE

	Command-line help : $ python tinaExtract.py --help

	$ cd PyTextMiner/

	first check fields value in config.yaml
	then type the following command-line

	$ python tinaExtract.py -i path_to/myfile.csv

	it will generate a statistics.zip file containing contents of the output directory
	without a input file specified, the software processes the default input (src/t/pubmed_tina_test.csv)

TESTED PLATFORMS

	PyTextMiner was tested on the following Linux platforms:
    
		Linux 64 bits (AMD64) with Python 2.5
		Linux 64 bits (AMD64) with Python 2.6

		Linux 32 bits (i686) with Python 2.5
		Linux 32 bits (i686) with Python 2.6
 
	However, if you experience problems, see "MANUAL INSTALL" section.

OUTPUTS

	An output directory

	Results of the process are stored into a new directory 'output', created by default into "$WORKDIR/PyTextMiner".

	This output contains three different kind of files:

		"out.db": is the relational database with n-grams and projects ids
		"documentSample.csv": provides a 10 projects sample in easy to read format of the kind of information stored in "out.db". You thus can check on a sample that this information is compatible with your needs.
		A set of csv files named "corpus_id-ngramOccPerCorpus.csv" that provides statistics for each batch.

	Here is an example of the content of sample csv file.

		document id,ngrams extracted
		"16710584","lesions displayed, which indicates, associated with,
		was detected, to valproate after, a case of, systemic, her skin,[etc]"


	Here is an example of the statistics on a corpus where are listed the n-grams extracted with their occurence within the batch and the part-of-speech tagged version of the n-grams: 

		"ngram","documents","POS tagged"
		"defects","9","NNS_defects"
		"defence","3","NN_defence"
		"staphylococcus","2","NNP_Staphylococcus"
		"cd t cells","2","NNP_CD NNP_T VBZ_cells"
		"blood vessels","4","NN_blood NNS_vessels"

	A zipped output directory

		All the above files are zipped into a single file that can be directly sent to your coworkers. This file is named 'statistics.zip' and can be found in current $WORKDIR/PyTextMiner directory.
