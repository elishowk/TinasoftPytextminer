Bioactivation to selenols (RSeH) by      beta-lyases is thought to be critical, but the mechanism of tumor suppression      remains unclear. Induction of phase II biotransformation enzymes is a possible      mechanism of chemoprevention. In this study, we evaluated the isoform-selective      induction of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) at the mRNA level using a      quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. In cultured      primary rat hepatocytes and H35 Reuber rat hepatoma cells, SeCys-conjugates      time-dependently increased mRNA levels of GST Alpha isoforms and GST Pi, but not       of GST Mu isoforms. Se-allyl-L-selenocysteine, the most potent chemopreventive      SeCys-conjugate so far known, was also the most active GST inducer. After      exposure for 24hr, it elevated GSTA2, GSTA3, GSTA5, and GSTP mRNA levels in      primary hepatocytes 3.2+/-0.4-, 1.9+/-0.1-, 4.3+/-0.3-, and 2.9+/-0.3-fold,      respectively. Se-allyl-D-selenocysteine was significantly less active, suggesting      that stereoselective conversion of SeCys-conjugates to selenols is involved in      GST induction. In H35 Reuber hepatoma cells, where conversion of SeCys-conjugates      to selenols was 2-6-fold lower than in primary hepatocytes, GST induction was      also much lower than in primary hepatocytes. SeCys-conjugates did not induce      cytochrome P450 1A1, 2B1/2, or 3A1. This indicates that SeCys-conjugates are      monofunctional inducers of phase II biotransformation enzymes. The present      results suggest that induction of GST expression contributes to the      chemopreventive activity of SeCys-conjugates.AD  - Leiden/Amsterdam Center for Drug Research, Division of Molecular Toxicology, De      Boelelaan 1083, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.FAU - 't Hoen, Peter A CAU  - 't Hoen PAFAU - Rooseboom, MartijnAU  - Rooseboom MFAU - Bijsterbosch, Martin KAU  - Bijsterbosch MKFAU - van Berkel, Theo J CAU  - van Berkel TJFAU - Vermeulen, Nico P EAU  - Vermeulen NPFAU - Commandeur, Jan N MAU  - Commandeur JNLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - Biochem PharmacolJT  - Biochemical pharmacologyJID - 0101032RN  - 0 (RNA, Messenger)RN  - 0 (Selenium Compounds)RN  - 0 (selenol)RN  - 10236-58-5 (Selenocysteine)RN  - 9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)RN  - EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)RN  - EC 4.- (Lyases)SB  - IMMH  - AnimalsMH  - Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/biosynthesisMH  - Enzyme Induction/drug effectsMH  - Glutathione Transferase/*biosynthesisMH  - Hepatocytes/drug effects/metabolismMH  - Lyases/metabolismMH  - RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/drug effectsMH  - RatsMH  - Selenium Compounds/metabolismMH  - Selenocysteine/chemistry/*pharmacologyMH  - Tumor Cells, CulturedEDAT- 2002/05/30 10:00MHDA- 2002/07/13 10:01CRDT- 2002/05/30 10:00AID - S0006295202009875 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Biochem Pharmacol. 2002 May 15;63(10):1843-9.PMID- 19796502OWN - NLMSTAT- PublisherDA  - 20091002IS  - 1555-3892 (Electronic)DP  - 2009 Sep 28TI  - Functional characterization of hepatocytes for cell transplantation: customized      cell preparation for each receptor.AB  - The first indication of hepatocyte transplantation is inborn liver-based      metabolic disorders and among which, urea cycle disorders leading to the      impairment to detoxify ammonia and Crigler-Najjar Syndrome type I, a deficiency      in the hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1, present the highest incidence.      Metabolically qualified human hepatocytes are required for clinical infusion. We       proposed fast and sensitive procedures to determine their suitability for      transplantation. For this purpose, viability, attachment efficiency and metabolic      functionality (ureogenic capability, cytochrome P450 and phase II activities) are      assayed prior to clinical cell infusion to determine the quality of hepatocytes.       Moreover, the evaluation of urea synthesis from ammonia and      UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 activity, a newly developed assay using      beta-estradiol as substrate, allows the possibility of customizing cell      preparation for receptors with urea cycle disorders or Crigler-Najjar Syndrome      type I. Sources of human liver and factors derived from the procurement of the      liver sample (warm and cold ischemia) have also been investigated. The results      show that grafts with a cold ischemia time exceeding 15 h and steatosis should      not be accepted for hepatocyte transplantation. Finally, livers from non      heart-beating donors are apparently a potential suitable source of hepatocytes      which could enlarge the liver donor pool.AU  - A BCAU  - Mt DAU  - A LAU  - E PAU  - J MAU  - Jv CAU  - Mj GLLA  - ENGPT  - JOURNAL ARTICLEDEP - 20090928TA  - Cell TransplantJT  - Cell transplantationJID - 9208854EDAT- 2009/10/03 06:00MHDA- 2009/10/03 06:00CRDT- 2009/10/03 06:00AID - ct2163bonoracentelles [pii]AID - 10.3727/096368909X474267 [doi]PST - aheadofprintSO  - Cell Transplant. 2009 Sep 28.PMID- 10998499OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20010517DCOM- 20010621LR  - 20061115IS  - 0166-445X (Print)VI  - 51IP  - 1DP  - 2000 NovTI  - Effects of primary- and secondary-treated bleached kraft mill effluents on the      immune system and physiological parameters of roach.PG  - 55-67AB  - The present study was designed to examine, whether, effluents from a modern pulp       and paper mill using elemental chlorine-free/total chlorine-free (ECF/TCF)      bleaching, exert effects on the immune system of fish and, in addition, to relate      these findings to physiological parameters known to be affected by bleached      kraft-mill effluents (BKME). Roach (Rutilus rutilus) were exposed in laboratory      conditions to primary- or secondary-treated effluent from a pulp and paper mill.       In order to study their capability to respond to foreign antigens they were      immunised with bovine gamma-globulin (BGG) prior to exposure. The number of      anti-BGG antibody-secreting cells (ASC) and the number of      immunoglobulin-secreting cells (ISC) in the spleen and blood as well as the level      of anti-BGG specific antibodies and concentration of plasma immunoglobulin (IgM)       were studied. Phagocytosis and migration of granulocytes of the head kidney were       also determined. In addition to the immunological parameters, the activity of      hepatic biotransformation enzymes, the carbohydrate metabolism and osmoregulation      were examined. Exposure of roach for 21 days to BKME affected several      immunological parameters. Both effluents, primary- and secondary-treated,      impaired the immunoreactivity of the fish. Sex-related differences in the immune       responses were evident in many parameters e.g. in the number of blood ISC and      splenic ASC. Sex also had effects on cortisol levels and in the induction of      7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD). These results demonstrate that both      primary- and secondary-treated effluent from a pulp and paper mill using ECF/TCF       bleaching have effects on fish immune functions. Further, these findings suggest       that steroids may contribute to immunomodulation in fish.AD  - Department of Biological and Environmental Science, University of Jyvaskyla, PO      Box 35, FIN-40100, Jyvaskyla, Finland. tumiaa@jyu.fiFAU - Aaltonen, T MAU  - Aaltonen TMFAU - Jokinen, E IAU  - Jokinen EIFAU - Lappivaara, JAU  - Lappivaara JFAU - Markkula, S EAU  - Markkula SEFAU - Salo, H MAU  - Salo HMFAU - Leppanen, HAU  - Leppanen HFAU - Lammi, RAU  - Lammi RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - NetherlandsTA  - Aquat ToxicolJT  - Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)JID - 8500246RN  - 0 (Immunoglobulin M)RN  - 0 (Industrial Waste)RN  - 0 (Liver Glycogen)RN  - 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)RN  - 50-23-7 (Hydrocortisone)RN  - 7782-50-5 (Chlorine)RN  - EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)RN  - EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)SB  - IMMH  - Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolismMH  - AnimalsMH  - Carbohydrate MetabolismMH  - Cell Movement/drug effectsMH  - Chlorine/toxicityMH  - Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/biosynthesisMH  - Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent AssayMH  - Fishes/*immunologyMH  - Fresh Water/analysisMH  - Gills/drug effects/enzymologyMH  - Hydrocortisone/bloodMH  - Immune System/*drug effectsMH  - Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesisMH  - Industrial Waste/*adverse effects/analysisMH  - Liver Glycogen/metabolismMH  - Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunologyMH  - Neutrophils/drug effects/immunologyMH  - *PaperMH  - Respiratory Burst/drug effectsMH  - Water Pollutants, Chemical/analysis/*toxicityMH  - Water-Electrolyte Balance/drug effectsEDAT- 2000/09/22MHDA- 2001/06/22 10:01CRDT- 2000/09/22 00:00AID - S0166-445X(00)00101-6 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Aquat Toxicol. 2000 Nov;51(1):55-67.PMID- 15969889OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20050622DCOM- 20051003LR  - 20061115IS  - 0300-7995 (Print)VI  - 21IP  - 6DP  - 2005 JunTI  - Optimising antiemetic therapy: what are the problems and how can they be      overcome?PG  - 885-97AB  - BACKGROUND: Management of chemotherapy- or radiotherapy-induced emesis has      improved significantly following the introduction of the 5-HT3-receptor      antagonists. Prophylactic use of these agents is recommended for the prevention      of both chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, given with a       corticosteroid. Despite these advances, nausea and vomiting remain among the most      feared and debilitating adverse effects of cytotoxic therapy. The shift towards a      more elderly population of patients with cancer presents additional      considerations for supportive care, with an emphasis on achieving control of      nausea and vomiting, whilst minimising toxicity and avoiding drug-drug      interactions. This review presents some of the key issues for consideration in      optimising antiemetic therapy. The PubMed search engine was used to search for      relevant literature (up to December 2004) and relevant international congress      materials collected during 2003 and 2004. SCOPE: While the early stages of nausea      and vomiting are 5-HT-mediated, identification of a role for substance P in late       emesis has led to the development of the NK1-receptor antagonist, aprepitant. As       a new agent, the clinical profile of aprepitant is still being explored,      including its interaction with concomitant medications. Patients who achieve good      control of acute and late-acute nausea and vomiting have a reduced risk of      experiencing delayed onset symptoms, emphasising the importance of prophylactic      management with effective agents. Although the 5-HT3-receptor antagonists are      widely considered to have equivalent efficacy, they vary in half-life and the      nature of antagonism at receptors. Their metabolic profiles also differ, with      cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolism affecting their propensity for drug-drug      interactions. Several sets of guidelines are available that outline      recommendations for selection and use of antiemetic therapy. However, under-use      of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists has been reported in both the radiotherapy and      chemotherapy settings, and some commonly used doses may be suboptimal.      CONCLUSION: In optimising antiemetic therapy, wider implementation of guidelines       is desirable, as is consideration of each patient's individual needs. Safety and       tolerability of supportive care medications should be a key consideration, and      cardiovascular warnings and the possibility of drug-drug interactions should be      given sufficient consideration, particularly in view of the older age of the      population with cancer.AD  - Clinique de Genolier, 1272, Genolier, Switzerland. maapro@genolier.netFAU - Aapro, MattiAU  - Aapro MLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - ReviewPL  - EnglandTA  - Curr Med Res OpinJT  - Current medical research and opinionJID - 0351014RN  - 0 (Antiemetics)RN  - 0 (Antineoplastic Agents)RN  - 0 (Receptors, Serotonin, 5-HT3)RN  - 0 (Serotonin Antagonists)SB  - IMMH  - AgedMH  - Antiemetics/*therapeutic useMH  - Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effectsMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Nausea/etiology/*prevention & controlMH  - Radiotherapy/adverse effectsMH  - Receptors, Serotonin, 5-HT3/*antagonists & inhibitorsMH  - Serotonin Antagonists/*therapeutic useMH  - SwitzerlandMH  - Vomiting/etiology/*prevention & controlRF  - 118EDAT- 2005/06/23 09:00MHDA- 2005/10/04 09:00CRDT- 2005/06/23 09:00AID - 10.1185/030079905X46313 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Curr Med Res Opin. 2005 Jun;21(6):885-97.PMID- 15764291OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20050317DCOM- 20050505LR  - 20061115IS  - 1354-750X (Print)VI  - 9IP  - 3DP  - 2004 May-JunTI  - Scoring approach based on fish biomarkers applied to French river monitoring.PG  - 258-70AB  - The aim was to apply a multimarker scoring approach as complementary to      freshwater monitoring programmes carried out by the Water Agency Adour-Garonne.      Fish (chub, barbel and trout) were collected in 11 sites in rivers in south-west       France. Five biomarkers of response were measured either in muscle or brain for      acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and in liver for glutathione S-transferase, catalase       and 7-ethoxyresorufine O-deethylase. As a result of multivariate analysis, sites       were clearly discriminated mainly by 7-ethoxyresorufine O-deethylase and      acetylcholinesterase activities. According to the scoring approach, a multimarker      pollution index was calculated for each sampling site as the sum of the response       index of the five measured biomarkers (pollution index). Sorting was established       by ranging the sites from lightly to highly contaminated locations.AD  - Laboratoire de Physico-Toxicochimie des systemes Naturels, UMR 5472 CNRS,      Universite Bordeaux I, F-33405 Talence, France.FAU - Aarab, NadiaAU  - Aarab NFAU - Champeau, OlivierAU  - Champeau OFAU - Mora, PascalAU  - Mora PFAU - Daubeze, MicheleAU  - Daubeze MFAU - Garrigues, PhilippeAU  - Garrigues PFAU - Narbonne, Jean-FrancoisAU  - Narbonne JFLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - EnglandTA  - BiomarkersJT  - Biomarkers : biochemical indicators of exposure, response, and susceptibility to       chemicalsJID - 9606000RN  - 0 (Biological Markers)RN  - 0 (Environmental Pollutants)RN  - EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)RN  - EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)RN  - EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)RN  - EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)SB  - IMMH  - Acetylcholinesterase/metabolismMH  - AnimalsMH  - *Biological MarkersMH  - Brain/metabolismMH  - Catalase/metabolismMH  - Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/metabolismMH  - *Environmental PollutantsMH  - FishesMH  - FranceMH  - Glutathione Transferase/metabolismMH  - Models, StatisticalMH  - Multivariate AnalysisMH  - Muscles/metabolismMH  - RiversMH  - Subcellular FractionsEDAT- 2005/03/15 09:00MHDA- 2005/05/06 09:00CRDT- 2005/03/15 09:00AID - QVFBNK99CDCA280C [pii]AID - 10.1080/13547500400015626 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Biomarkers. 2004 May-Jun;9(3):258-70.PMID- 16338282OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20051212DCOM- 20060425LR  - 20061115IS  - 0009-9236 (Print)VI  - 78IP  - 6DP  - 2005 DecTI  - Effect of low-dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) on the activity of cytochrome      P450 2D6 in healthy volunteers.PG  - 664-74AB  - OBJECTIVE: In the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection, the      protease inhibitor ritonavir is used in a low dose (100 mg twice daily) to      inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and thereby increase plasma concentrations of      coadministered protease inhibitors. When applied in a therapeutic dose (600 mg      twice daily), ritonavir also inhibits CYP2D6. The effect of low-dose ritonavir on      CYP2D6 is unknown and was investigated in this study. METHODS: This was a 1-arm,       2-period, fixed-order study in 13 healthy male volunteers who were extensive      metabolizers of CYP2D6. The first period examined baseline CYP2D6 activity by      evaluating the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of desipramine and by metabolic       phenotyping with dextromethorphan. During the second period, participants took      ritonavir, 100 mg twice daily, for 2 weeks, followed by repeat assessment of      desipramine pharmacokinetics and the dextromethorphan metabolic phenotype in the       presence of ritonavir. RESULTS: Low-dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily)      significantly increased the exposure to single-dose desipramine, as reflected in       a geometric mean ratio (with ritonavir/without ritonavir) of 1.26 (95% confidence      interval, 1.13-1.40) for the desipramine area under the concentration versus time      curve from time 0 to infinity (P < .001). Coadministration of low-dose ritonavir       did not significantly affect the dextromethorphan/dextrorphan urinary metabolic      ratio and did not convert any extensive metabolizer to a poor metabolizer.      CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) exerts a modest inhibitory      effect on the activity of CYP2D6 in extensive metabolizers, as assessed with      desipramine as the index substrate. This effect was not apparent with the      dextromethorphan/dextrorphan metabolic ratio as an indicator for CYP2D6 activity.      It is expected that the effect of low-dose ritonavir on CYP2D6 will not require      standard dose reductions for CYP2D6 substrates.AD  - Departments of Clinical Pharmacy and General Internal Medicine, Nijmegen      University Centre for Infectious Diseases, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical      Centre, 6500 HB Nijmegen, the Netherlands.

In this population, extension of multiple resistance to anti-tuberculous      drugs is also a matter of anxiety. HIV-induced immunosuppression modifies the      clinical presentation of TB, resulting in atypical signs and symptoms, and more      frequent extrapulmonary dissemination. The treatment of TB is also more difficult      to manage in HIV-infected patients, particularly with regard to pharmacological      interactions secondary to inhibition or induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes by      protease inhibitors with rifampicin or rifabutin, respectively.

Serum concentrations of the      metabolites mediated by these enzymes were measured, from which the      precursor-to-product ratios were calculated. Seven patients underwent      adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation. Findings were compared to previously      published data on age matched normal boys. RESULTS: A total of 11 boys had      evidence of impaired function of 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase alone or in      combination with impaired 17,20-lyase or 17alpha-hydroxylase activity. An      additional 4 boys had evidence of isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency. Thus, of the      30 boys studied 15 (50%) had evidence of a testosterone biosynthetic defect. The       effect of adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation varied with widening of the      precursor-to-product ratios in some boys and narrowing in others. CONCLUSIONS: A       high incidence of 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 17,20-lyase deficiency      was found in boys with proximal hypospadias. The response to adrenocorticotropic       hormone stimulation suggests that enzymes in the adrenal glands and testes may be      affected independently. Our findings support the hypothesis that hypospadias is      the result of fetal endocrinopathy.AD  - Department of Urology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, USA.FAU - Aaronson, I AAU  - Aaronson IAFAU - Cakmak, M AAU  - Cakmak MAFAU - Key, L LAU  - Key LLLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - UNITED STATESTA  - J UrolJT  - The Journal of urologyJID - 0376374RN  - 58-22-0 (Testosterone)RN  - EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)RN  - EC 1.1.- (17-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases)RN  - EC 1.1.1.51 (3 (or 17)-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)RN  - EC 1.14.99.9 (Steroid 17-alpha-Hydroxylase)SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - 17-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/*metabolismMH  - AdolescentMH  - ChildMH  - Child, PreschoolMH  - HumansMH  - Hypospadias/*enzymologyMH  - InfantMH  - MaleMH  - Mixed Function Oxygenases/*metabolismMH  - Steroid 17-alpha-Hydroxylase/*metabolismMH  - Testosterone/*biosynthesisEDAT- 1997/05/01MHDA- 1997/05/01 00:01CRDT- 1997/05/01 00:00AID - S0022-5347(01)64893-6 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - J Urol. 1997 May;157(5):1884-8.PMID- 6294581OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19830214DCOM- 19830214LR  - 20061115IS  - 0031-4005 (Print)VI  - 71IP  - 1DP  - 1983 JanTI  - Effect of parathyroid hormone on cAMP and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D formation and      renal handling of phosphate in vitamin D-dependent rickets.PG  - 59-63AB  - Studies were carried out to compare the effects of parathyroid extract (PTE) on      the serum concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2D),      24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (24,25[OH]2D), 25,26-dihydroxy vitamin D (25,26[OH]2D)      and cAMP, and the urinary excretion of calcium, phosphorus, and cAMP in two      normal adult subjects, and in a girl with vitamin D-dependent rickets. The      concentration of 1,25[OH]2D was markedly decreased even when she was receiving a       daily dose of 25,000 IU of ergocalciferol. PTE infusion resulted in a prompt and       distinct increase in the serum levels and the urinary excretion of cAMP in the      patient and control subjects. In the control subjects the serum concentration of       1,25[OH]2D increased after the PTE infusion, whereas there was no response in the      patient with vitamin D-dependent rickets. The two other dihydroxylated      metabolites of vitamin D showed no consistent response to the PTE infusion in the      control subjects or the patient. The patient showed no phosphaturic response to      PTE while she was receiving high-dosage ergocalciferol treatment. By contrast,      when the patient was re-studied after therapy with 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D, PTE       infusion resulted in an increase in urinary phosphate excretion. These findings      might lend support for the notion that 1,25[OH]2D has an effect on tubular      phosphate resorption and has a permissive role in the phosphaturic effect of      parathyroid hormone. The present findings also confirm that the formation of      1,25[OH]2D is impaired in vitamin D-dependent rickets and indicate that the renal      25-hydroxyvitamin D-1 alpha-hydroxylase is unresponsive to the stimulatory effect      of parathyroid hormone in this condition.FAU - Aarskog, DAU  - Aarskog DFAU - Aksnes, LAU  - Aksnes LFAU - Markestad, TAU  - Markestad TLA  - engPT  - Case ReportsPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - PediatricsJT  - PediatricsJID - 0376422RN  - 0 (Dihydroxycholecalciferols)RN  - 0 (Parathyroid Hormone)RN  - 0 (Phosphates)RN  - 60-92-4 (Cyclic AMP)RN  - EC 1.14.- (25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-Hydroxylase)RN  - EC 1.14.- (Steroid Hydroxylases)SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-HydroxylaseMH  - Cyclic AMP/*biosynthesisMH  - Dihydroxycholecalciferols/*biosynthesisMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Hypophosphatemia, Familial/*drug therapy/metabolismMH  - InfantMH  - Kidney/*metabolismMH  - Parathyroid Hormone/*therapeutic useMH  - Phosphates/*metabolismMH  - Steroid Hydroxylases/metabolismEDAT- 1983/01/01MHDA- 1983/01/01 00:01CRDT- 1983/01/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Pediatrics. 1983 Jan;71(1):59-63.PMID- 3938271OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19860410DCOM- 19860410LR  - 20031114IS  - 0171-9750 (Print)VI  - 8DP  - 1985TI  - Inhalation of butanols: changes in the cytochrome P-450 enzyme system.PG  - 418-21AB  - After inhalation of different butanol isomers for 3 days (2000 ppm) and 5 days      (500 ppm), liver and kidney parameters of the microsomal cytochrome P-450 enzyme       system were increased. sec-Butanol caused the highest increase in cytochrome      P-450 concentration with a 47% rise in the kidneys (500 ppm for 5 days) and 33%      in the liver (2000 ppm for 3 days). A concomitant increase of the in vitro      n-hexane metabolism in liver microsomes was observed with a 77% increased      formation of the preneurotoxic metabolite 2-hexanol compared with control.      iso-Butanol did not alter total cytochrome P-450 concentration but caused a      significant 30% decrease in the formation of 2-hexanol. Inhalation of all      butanols slightly decreased the enzyme levels in the lung. Changes in microsomal       enzymes did not correlate with measured serum concentrations of the different      butanols showing different inducing capacities among the butanol isomers      themselves or the participation of metabolites in the inducing process. As a      conclusion sec-butanol, probably through its metabolite methyl-ethyl-ketone, is      the most potent inducer of microsomal cytochrome P-450 in liver and kidney while       iso-butanol does not alter total cytochrome P-450.FAU - Aarstad, KAU  - Aarstad KFAU - Zahlsen, KAU  - Zahlsen KFAU - Nilsen, O GAU  - Nilsen OGLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - GERMANY, WESTTA  - Arch Toxicol SupplJT  - Archives of toxicology.

In the recombinant      Hepa1c1c7 mouse hepatoma (H1L1.1c7) cells strong antagonistic interaction of      2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB52) with luciferase expression induced by      2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl      (PCB77) was observed, and similarly, between 2,2',3,3',4,4'-hexachlorobiphenyl      (PCB128) and PCB77. Accordingly, PCB52 was found to inhibit      ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) induction by PCB77 in wild-type Hepa1c1c7      cells. In contrast, the antagonistic effect of PCB52 on TCDD-induced luciferase      expression was only minor in recombinant guinea pig GPC16 colon adenocarcinoma      (G16L1.1c8) and human HepG2 hepatoma (HG2L1.1c3) cells, and intermediate in      recombinant H4IIE rat hepatoma (H4L1.1c4) cells. Gel retardation studies using a       32 P-labelled dioxin responsive element (DRE)-containing oligonucleotide, and      ligand binding studies using [3H]TCDD, demonstrated that the species-specific      antagonistic activity of PCB52 on Ah receptor-controlled luciferase expression is      due to inhibition of Ah receptor ligand and DNA binding. We conclude, that      Ah-mediated luciferase expression provides a useful tool to study the species      specificity of Ah receptor (ant)agonists.AD  - Department of Toxicology, Agricultural University, Wageningen, Netherlands.FAU - Aarts, J MAU  - Aarts JMFAU - Denison, M SAU  - Denison MSFAU - Cox, M AAU  - Cox MAFAU - Schalk, M AAU  - Schalk MAFAU - Garrison, P MAU  - Garrison PMFAU - Tullis, KAU  - Tullis KFAU - de Haan, L HAU  - de Haan LHFAU - Brouwer, AAU  - Brouwer ALA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - NETHERLANDSTA  - Eur J PharmacolJT  - European journal of pharmacologyJID - 1254354RN  - 0 (Polychlorinated Biphenyls)RN  - 0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)RN  - 1746-01-6 (Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin)RN  - 32598-13-3 (3,4,3',4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl)RN  - 35693-99-3 (2,5,2',5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl)RN  - 38380-07-3 (2,3,4,2',3',4'-hexachlorobiphenyl)RN  - 9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)RN  - EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)RN  - EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)RN  - EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)SB  - IMMH  - AnimalsMH  - Base SequenceMH  - Carcinoma, HepatocellularMH  - Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1MH  - Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/biosynthesisMH  - Enzyme InductionMH  - Guinea PigsMH  - HumansMH  - Luciferases/biosynthesisMH  - MiceMH  - Mice, Inbred C57BLMH  - Molecular Sequence DataMH  - Oxidoreductases/biosynthesisMH  - Polychlorinated Biphenyls/*pharmacologyMH  - RatsMH  - Rats, Sprague-DawleyMH  - Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/*antagonists & inhibitorsMH  - Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin/pharmacologyMH  - Tumor Cells, CulturedEDAT- 1995/12/07MHDA- 1995/12/07 00:01CRDT- 1995/12/07 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Eur J Pharmacol. 1995 Dec 7;293(4):463-74.PMID- 11570803OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20010925DCOM- 20020207LR  - 20061115IS  - 0141-1136 (Print)VI  - 52IP  - 3DP  - 2001 SepTI  - Evidence of uptake, biotransformation and DNA binding of polyaromatic      hydrocarbons in Atlantic cod and corkwing wrasse caught in the vicinity of an      aluminium works.PG  - 213-29AB  - Feral Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and corkwing wrasse (Symphodus melops) were      investigated for polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contamination in the Karmsund      strait, western Norway. This strait is highly contaminated with PAHs, and a main       source is the chronic release of gas-scrubbing effluents from a local aluminium      works. In both species, the level of biliary PAH metabolites and hepatic DNA      adducts were higher in fish collected near the aluminium works. Interestingly, a       significantly higher level of both biliary PAH metabolites and hepatic DNA      adducts was found in corkwing wrasse as compared to cod, indicating a higher      potential for genotoxic effects in this species. Hepatic cytochrome P4501A      (CYP1A) in cod estimated by ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and an immunoassay      technique (ELISA), seemed to be weakly induced at the contaminated sites. At the       most contaminated site, skin ulcers and fin erosion were detected in about 70 and      45% of the cods, respectively. The data demonstrated that both cod and corkwing      wrasse may be suitable target species for PAH pollution monitoring.AD  - RF-Rogaland Research, Stavanger, Norway. endre.aas@rf.noFAU - Aas, EAU  - Aas EFAU - Beyer, JAU  - Beyer JFAU - Jonsson, GAU  - Jonsson GFAU - Reichert, W LAU  - Reichert WLFAU - Andersen, O KAU  - Andersen OKLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - EnglandTA  - Mar Environ ResJT  - Marine environmental researchJID - 9882895RN  - 0 (DNA Adducts)RN  - 0 (Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic)RN  - 0 (Water Pollutants, Chemical)RN  - 7429-90-5 (Aluminum)RN  - EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)SB  - IMMH  - AluminumMH  - AnimalsMH  - Bile/*metabolismMH  - BiotransformationMH  - Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/metabolismMH  - DNA Adducts/analysis/*metabolismMH  - Environmental MonitoringMH  - Fishes/*metabolismMH  - Liver/enzymology/*metabolism/pathologyMH  - MetallurgyMH  - Perciformes/metabolismMH  - Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic/*pharmacokinetics/toxicityMH  - Skin/pathologyMH  - Water Pollutants, Chemical/*pharmacokinetics/toxicityEDAT- 2001/09/26 10:00MHDA- 2002/02/08 10:01CRDT- 2001/09/26 10:00AID - S0141-1136(00)00269-5 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Mar Environ Res. 2001 Sep;52(3):213-29.PMID- 11064127OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20010517DCOM- 20010621LR  - 20061115IS  - 0166-445X (Print)VI  - 51IP  - 2DP  - 2000 DecTI  - PAH metabolites in bile, cytochrome P4501A and DNA adducts as environmental risk       parameters for chronic oil exposure: a laboratory experiment with Atlantic cod.PG  - 241-58AB  - In order to perform environmental risk assessments with regard to oil      contamination in the sea, it is important to obtain knowledge about threshold      levels for possible adverse effects in marine organisms. With this objective in      mind, selected biomarkers were studied in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) chronically      exposed to mechanically dispersed crude oil. The fish were exposed for 30 days in      a continuous flow system to nominal concentrations of 0.06, 0.25 and 1 ppm North       Sea crude oil. Fish were sampled five times during the exposure period. In      addition, the 1 ppm group and the control group were sampled 1 week after the end      of exposure. Polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations in the seawater were      analysed regularly by direct fluorescence and, at one occasion, by gas      chromatography with mass spectrographic detection (GC/MS) measurements. Liver      samples were analysed for parent PAH levels by means of GC/MS measurements, and      PAH metabolites in bile were analysed by means of fixed wavelength fluorescence.       Cytochrome P450 induction in liver was estimated by ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase       (EROD) activity, and hepatic DNA adducts were analysed by the 32P-postlabelling      assay. The parent PAH concentrations in liver showed peak levels 3 days after the      start of exposure, followed by a reduction towards the end of the experiment. In       contrast, the PAH metabolites in bile and EROD activity showed generally      increasing levels throughout the whole exposure period, indicating an increased      biotransformation efficiency. The level of DNA adducts in the 1 ppm group showed       a stable increase during the entire exposure period. Only a slight,      non-significant decrease in DNA adduct levels was observed after 7 days of      recovery in clean water. Exposure-dependent responses were observed for all three      biomarkers. The lowest nominal concentration of dispersed oil in water, 0.06 ppm,      corresponded to a measured total PAH concentration in the water of 0.3 ppb.      Atlantic cod exposed to this concentration showed increased levels of PAH      metabolites in bile and a slight induction of CYP1A, as well as formation of DNA       adducts when compared with control fish. Particularly noteworthy is the detection      of DNA adducts at such a low exposure concentration of oil in water, which, to      our knowledge, is a novel finding. These dose-response data may serve as useful      contributions when assessing environmental risk with regard to marine oil      pollution.AD  - RF-Rogaland Research, P.O.

The pharmacokinetics of ethylmorphine after administration of a single dose of      the cough mixture Cosylan were investigated in 10 healthy subjects. 2. The median      urinary recovery of ethylmorphine and measured metabolites was 77% over 48 h. The      median tmax of unchanged ethylmorphine was 45 min, and the terminal elimination      t1/2 was 2 h. Ethylmorphine-6-glucuronide was found to be the major metabolite.      3. Two subjects had significantly lower urinary recovery (0.48 h) of morphine and      morphine-glucuronides than the remainder. Furthermore, these two had urinary      metabolic ratios (MRO) and partial metabolic clearances (CLmO) for O-deethylation      of ethylmorphine tentatively classifying them phenotypically as poor metabolisers      of the debrisoquine/sparteine type. 4. Genotyping for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6      alleles revealed five homozygote (wt/wt) and five heterozygote subjects. Two      subjects phenotypically classified as poor metabolisers were genotypically      CYP2D6A/wt and CYP2D6D/wt, respectively. 5. Serum and urine samples taken more      than 8 and 24 h after administration of ethyl-morphine respectively, contained      morphine and morphine-glucuronides, but no ethylmorphine,      ethylmorphine-6-glucuronide or (serum only) norethylmorphine. Norethylmorphine      could be detected after hydrolysis of urine samples in all subjects. The urinary       recovery of the active metabolites morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide after      administration of ethylmorphine varied by a factor of 9 between individuals. 6.      The wide variation in recovery of morphine and morphine-glucuronides after oral      administration of ethylmorphine could not be explained simply by a difference in       CYP2D6 genotype. Constitutional variation in other enzymatic pathways involved in      ethylmorphine metabolism is probably crucial. Ratios of morphine to parent drug      cannot be used to distinguish the source of morphine after administration of      ethylmorphine. Norethylmorphine should be included in urine assays for opiates in      forensic toxicology, and no firm conclusions about the source of morphine are      possible based on serum samples obtained more than 24 h after drug      administration.AD  - National Institute of Forensic Toxicology, Oslo, Norway.FAU - Aasmundstad, T AAU  - Aasmundstad TAFAU - Xu, B QAU  - Xu BQFAU - Johansson, IAU  - Johansson IFAU - Ripel, AAU  - Ripel AFAU - Bjorneboe, AAU  - Bjorneboe AFAU - Christophersen, A SAU  - Christophersen ASFAU - Bodd, EAU  - Bodd EFAU - Morland, JAU  - Morland JLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - ENGLANDTA  - Br J Clin PharmacolJT  - British journal of clinical pharmacologyJID - 7503323RN  - 0 (Glucuronates)RN  - 57-27-2 (Morphine)RN  - 76-58-4 (Ethylmorphine)RN  - 9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - BiotransformationMH  - Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics/metabolismMH  - Drug Administration ScheduleMH  - Ethylmorphine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokineticsMH  - GenotypeMH  - Glucuronates/metabolismMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Morphine/metabolismPMC - PMC1365072OID - NLM: PMC1365072EDAT- 1995/06/01MHDA- 1995/06/01 00:01CRDT- 1995/06/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Br J Clin Pharmacol. 1995 Jun;39(6):611-20.PMID- 6254560OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19810226DCOM- 19810226LR  - 20041117IS  - 0306-5456 (Print)VI  - 87IP  - 12DP  - 1980 DecTI  - Male pseudohermaphroditism with 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency.

Venous blood samples      were collected from patients in groups, and polymerase chain reaction was      performed to determine the CYP17 gene polymorphism. Significant increase of A1/A1      and a decrease of A1/A2 genotype frequencies have been determined in patients      with endometrial cancer and with atypical endometrial hyperplasia.

It has been      characterized as a "known/likely" human carcinogen. Whereas its environmental      transformation and toxicity have been extensively examined, its metabolic      characteristics in mammalian livers have not been reported. This study was      designed to investigate diuron biotransformation and disposition because      metabolic routes, metabolizing enzymes, interactions, interspecies differences,      and interindividual variability are important for risk assessment purposes. The      only metabolic pathway detected by liquid chromatography/mass spectometry in      human liver homogenates and seven types of mammalian liver microsomes including      human was demethylation at the terminal nitrogen atom. No other phase I or phase       II metabolites were observed. The rank order of N-demethyldiuron formation in      liver microsomes based on intrinsic clearance (V(max)/K(m)) was dog > monkey >      rabbit > mouse > human > minipig > rat. All tested recombinant human cytochrome      P450s (P450s) catalyzed diuron N-demethylation and the highest activities were      possessed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. Relative contributions of human      CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 to hepatic diuron N-demethylation, based on average      abundances of P450 enzymes in human liver microsomes, were approximately 60, 14,       and 13%, respectively. Diuron inhibited relatively potently only CYP1A1/2 (IC(50)      4 microM). With human-derived and quantitative chemical-specific data, the      uncertainty factors for animal to human differences and for human variability in       toxicokinetics were within the range of the toxicokinetics default      uncertainty/safety factors for chemical risk assessment.AD  - Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, P.O.

These      effects are particularly well documented for the colon and rectum. Some      epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested that aspirin could also      be a chemopreventive agent against breast cancer. We investigated the effects of       the aspirin metabolite, salicylate (SA), on 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene      (DMBA)-DNA adduct formation as well as on the expression of the enzymes involved       in the carcinogen bioactivation pathway, in particular cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A)      and cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2). The effects of the test drug were examined      in both the human mammary carcinoma cell line, MCF-7, and mammary cells derived      from DMBA-induced rat mammary tumours (RMTCs). In this study, we also reported      the effects of SA on cell growth and viability in breast cancer cells (BCCs). The      results demonstrated that DMBA-DNA adduct formation in both cancer cell lines was      inhibited by SA at concentrations of > or = 2.5 mM. CYP1A was undetectable in      RMTCs while CYP1A induction by beta-naphthoflavone in MCF-7 cells was      significantly inhibited by SA in a concentration-dependent manner. Aspirin did      not affect COX-1 expression in either of the BCCs. COX-2 was not detected in      MCF-7 cells, but its expression in RMTCs was inhibited by SA treatment, which      also significantly reduced BCC growth, but failed to cause cell death by necrosis      or apoptosis. These data suggest that inhibition of DMBA-DNA adduct formation may      contribute to aspirin breast cancer chemopreventive action and indicate that this      drug can act in the first stage of carcinogenesis.AD  - Dipartimento di Scienze Cliniche e Biologiche, Universita di Torino, Torino,      Italy.FAU - Abbadessa, GiulianaAU  - Abbadessa GFAU - Spaccamiglio, AngelaAU  - Spaccamiglio AFAU - Sartori, Maria LuisaAU  - Sartori MLFAU - Nebbia, CarloAU  - Nebbia CFAU - Dacasto, MauroAU  - Dacasto MFAU - Di Carlo, FrancescoAU  - Di Carlo FFAU - Racca, SilviaAU  - Racca SLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - GreeceTA  - Int J OncolJT  - International journal of oncologyJID - 9306042RN  - 0 (7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-DNA adduct)RN  - 0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)RN  - 0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)RN  - 0 (DNA Adducts)RN  - 0 (Salicylates)RN  - 57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)RN  - EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)RN  - EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 1)RN  - EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)SB  - IMMH  - 9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists &      inhibitors/toxicityMH  - AnimalsMH  - Breast Neoplasms/pathologyMH  - Cell Line, TumorMH  - Cyclooxygenase 1/geneticsMH  - Cyclooxygenase 2/geneticsMH  - Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors/pharmacologyMH  - Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacologyMH  - Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/geneticsMH  - DNA Adducts/*antagonists & inhibitorsMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/pathologyMH  - RatsMH  - Rats, Sprague-DawleyMH  - Salicylates/*pharmacologyEDAT- 2006/04/06 09:00MHDA- 2006/05/25 09:00CRDT- 2006/04/06 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - Int J Oncol. 2006 May;28(5):1131-40.PMID- 15526353OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20041104DCOM- 20050105LR  - 20061115IS  - 1007-9327 (Print)VI  - 10IP  - 23DP  - 2004 Dec 1TI  - GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1 and CYP1A1 genetic polymorphisms and susceptibility to      esophageal cancer in a French population: different pattern of squamous cell      carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.PG  - 3389-93AB  - AIM: To evaluate the association between CYP1A1 and GSTs genetic polymorphisms      and susceptibility to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and esophageal      adenocarcinoma (ADC) in a high risk area of northwest of France. METHODS: A      case-control study was conducted to investigate the genetic polymorphisms of      these enzymes (CYP1A1*2C and GSTP1 exon 7 Val alleles, GSTM1*2/*2 and GSTT1*2/*2       null genotypes). A total of 79 esophageal cancer cases and 130 controls were      recruited. RESULTS: GSTM1*2/*2 and CYP1A1*1A/*2C genotype frequencies were higher      among squamous cell carcinomas at a level close to statistical significance (OR =      1.83, 95% CI 0.88-3.83, P = 0.11; OR = 3.03, 95% CI 0.93-9.90, P = 0.07,      respectively). For GSTP1 polymorphism, no difference was found between controls      and cases, whatever their histological status. Lower frequency of GSTT1 deletion       was observed in ADC group compared to controls with a statistically significant      difference (OR = 13.31, 95% CI 1.66-106.92, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: In SCC, our      results are consistent with the strong association of this kind of tumour with      tobacco exposure. In ADC, our results suggest 3 distinct hypotheses: (1)      activation of exogenous procarcinogens, such as small halogenated compounds by      GSTT1; (2) contribution of GSTT1 to the inflammatory response of esophageal      mucosa, which is known to be a strong risk factor for ADC, possibly through      leukotriene synthesis; (3) higher sensitivity to the inflammatory process      associated with intracellular depletion of glutathione.AD  - GRECAN-EA1772, UFR des Sciences Pharmaceutiques, Universite de Caen      Basse-Normandie et Centre Francois Baclesse, Avenue du General Harris, 14076 Caen      cedex 05, France.FAU - Abbas, AhmedAU  - Abbas AFAU - Delvinquiere, KarineAU  - Delvinquiere KFAU - Lechevrel, MathildeAU  - Lechevrel MFAU - Lebailly, PierreAU  - Lebailly PFAU - Gauduchon, PascalAU  - Gauduchon PFAU - Launoy, GuyAU  - Launoy GFAU - Sichel, FrancoisAU  - Sichel FLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - ChinaTA  - World J GastroenterolJT  - World journal of gastroenterology : WJGJID - 100883448RN  - EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)RN  - EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)RN  - EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)RN  - EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)RN  - EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)RN  - EC 3.1.1.67 (fatty acyl ethyl ester synthase)SB  - IMMH  - Acyltransferases/*geneticsMH  - Adenocarcinoma/epidemiology/*geneticsMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Aged, 80 and overMH  - Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/epidemiology/*geneticsMH  - Case-Control StudiesMH  - Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/*geneticsMH  - Esophageal Neoplasms/epidemiology/*geneticsMH  - FemaleMH  - FranceMH  - Genetic Predisposition to Disease/epidemiologyMH  - GenotypeMH  - Glutathione Transferase/*geneticsMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Polymorphism, GeneticMH  - Risk FactorsEDAT- 2004/11/05 09:00MHDA- 2005/01/06 09:00CRDT- 2004/11/05 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - World J Gastroenterol. 2004 Dec 1;10(23):3389-93.PMID- 18952161OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20090112DCOM- 20090324LR  - 20090410IS  - 0887-2333 (Print)VI  - 23IP  - 1DP  - 2009 FebTI  - Air pollution particulate matter (PM2.5)-induced gene expression of volatile      organic compound and/or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-metabolizing enzymes in      an in vitro coculture lung model.PG  - 37-46AB  - The overarching goals were: (i) to develop an in vitro coculture model, including      two relevant lung target cells: human alveolar macrophage (AM) isolated from      bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and immortalized cells originated from the normal      lung tissue of a human embryo (L132 cell line), as a future strategy for      near-realistic exposures to air pollution particulate matter (PM), and (ii) to      study the gene expression of volatile organic compound (VOC) and/or polycyclic      aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)-metabolizing enzymes in this in vitro coculture      model. Human AM and/or L132 cells in mono- and coculture were exposed for 24, 48       and 72h to Dunkerque City's PM2.5 at its lethal concentrations at 10% and 50%      (i.e. AM: LC10=14.93 microgPM/mL and LC50=74.63 microgPM/mL; L132: LC10=18.84      microgPM/mL and LC50=75.36 microgPM/mL), and the gene expression (i.e. Cytochrome      P450 1A1, CYP1A1; CYP2E1; CYP2F1; microsomal Epoxide Hydrolase; NADPH Quinone      Oxydo-Reductase-1, NQO1; and Glutathione S-Transferase pi-1 and mu-3, GST-pi1 and      GST-mu3) was studied. In human AM in mono- and coculture, and in L132 cells in      monoculture, VOC and/or PAH-coated onto PM induced the gene expression of CYP1A1,      CYP2E1, NQO1, GST-pi1, and/or GST-mu3. However, there were quiet different      outcomes based on the use of L132 cells in mono- vs. coculture: the pattern of      VOC and/or PAH-metabolizing enzymes induced by PM in L132 cells in monoculture      remained almost unaffected when in coculture with AM. Taken together, these      results reinforced the key role of PM-exposed target human AM in the defenses of       the human lung from external injuries, notably through their higher capacity to      retain PM, and indicated that carbonaceous cores of PM, as physical vector of the      penetration and retention of coated-VOC and/or PAH into cells, enabled them to      exert a longer toxicity. The use of such a near realistic exposure system could      also be a very useful and powerful tool to identify the mechanisms by which air      pollution PM induced adverse health effects.AD  - LCE-EA2598, Toxicologie Industrielle et Environnementale, MREI 2, Universite du      Littoral - Cote d'Opale, Maison de la Recherche en Environnement Industriel de      Dunkerque 2, 189A, Avenue Maurice Schumann, 59140 Dunkerque, France.FAU - Abbas, ImaneAU  - Abbas IFAU - Saint-Georges, FrancoiseAU  - Saint-Georges FFAU - Billet, SylvainAU  - Billet SFAU - Verdin, AnthonyAU  - Verdin AFAU - Mulliez, PhilippeAU  - Mulliez PFAU - Shirali, PirouzAU  - Shirali PFAU - Garcon, GuillaumeAU  - Garcon GLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20081008PL  - EnglandTA  - Toxicol In VitroJT  - Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with      BIBRAJID - 8712158RN  - 0 (Air Pollutants)RN  - 0 (Particulate Matter)RN  - 0 (Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic)RN  - 0 (RNA, Messenger)RN  - 0 (Volatile Organic Compounds)RN  - EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)SB  - IMMH  - Air Pollutants/*toxicityMH  - Cell Line, TransformedMH  - Coculture TechniquesMH  - Dose-Response Relationship, DrugMH  - Environmental MonitoringMH  - Epithelial Cells/*drug effects/enzymologyMH  - Gene ExpressionMH  - HumansMH  - Lung/cytologyMH  - Macrophages, Alveolar/*drug effects/enzymologyMH  - Oxidoreductases/*genetics/metabolismMH  - Particulate Matter/*toxicityMH  - Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic/*metabolismMH  - RNA, Messenger/metabolismMH  - Volatile Organic Compounds/*metabolismEDAT- 2008/10/28 09:00MHDA- 2009/03/25 09:00CRDT- 2008/10/28 09:00PHST- 2008/06/13 [received]PHST- 2008/09/02 [revised]PHST- 2008/09/30 [accepted]PHST- 2008/10/08 [aheadofprint]AID - S0887-2333(08)00246-4 [pii]AID - 10.1016/j.tiv.2008.09.020 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Toxicol In Vitro. 2009 Feb;23(1):37-46.

Cilostazol (OPC-13013) undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism. The      hydroxylation of the quinone moiety of cilostazol to OPC-13326 was the      predominant route in all the liver preparations studies. The hydroxylation of the      hexane moiety to OPC-13217 was the second most predominant route in vitro. 2.      Ketoconazole (1 microM) was the most potent inhibitor of both quinone and hexane       hydroxylation. Both the CYP2D6 inhibitor quinidine (0.1 microM) and the CYP2C19      inhibitor omeprazole (10 microM) failed to consistently inhibit metabolism of      cilostazol via either of these two predominant routes. 3. Data obtained from a      bank of pre-characterized human liver microsomes demonstrated a stronger      correlation (r2=0.68, P < 0.01) between metabolism of cilostazol to OPC-13326 and      metabolism of felodipine, a CYP3A probe, that with probes for any other isoform.       Cimetidine demonstrated concentration-dependent competitive inhibition of the      metabolism of cilostazol by both routes. 4. Kinetic data demonstrated a Km value       of 101 microM for cilostazol, suggesting a relatively low affinity of cilostazol       for CYP3A. While recombinant CYP1A2, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 were also able to      catalyze formation of specific cilostazol metabolites, they did not appear to      contribute significantly to cilostazol metabolism in whole human liver      microsomes.AD  - Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc., Rockville, Maryland 20850, USA.FAU - Abbas, RAU  - Abbas RFAU - Chow, C PAU  - Chow CPFAU - Browder, N JAU  - Browder NJFAU - Thacker, DAU  - Thacker DFAU - Bramer, S LAU  - Bramer SLFAU - Fu, C JAU  - Fu CJFAU - Forbes, WAU  - Forbes WFAU - Odomi, MAU  - Odomi MFAU - Flockhart, D AAU  - Flockhart DALA  - engPT  - In VitroPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - ENGLANDTA  - Hum Exp ToxicolJT  - Human & experimental toxicologyJID - 9004560RN  - 0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)RN  - 0 (Isoenzymes)RN  - 0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)RN  - 0 (Tetrazoles)RN  - 51481-61-9 (Cimetidine)RN  - 65277-42-1 (Ketoconazole)RN  - 72509-76-3 (Felodipine)RN  - 73590-58-6 (Omeprazole)RN  - 73963-72-1 (cilostazol)RN  - 9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)SB  - IMMH  - Chromatography, High Pressure LiquidMH  - Cimetidine/pharmacologyMH  - Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolismMH  - Drug InteractionsMH  - Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacologyMH  - Felodipine/metabolismMH  - HumansMH  - Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolismMH  - Ketoconazole/pharmacologyMH  - Microsomes, Liver/*metabolismMH  - Omeprazole/pharmacologyMH  - Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/*metabolismMH  - Tetrazoles/*metabolismEDAT- 2000/07/13 11:00MHDA- 2000/10/21 11:01CRDT- 2000/07/13 11:00PST - ppublishSO  - Hum Exp Toxicol. 2000 Mar;19(3):178-84.PMID- 7403256OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19801021DCOM- 19801021LR  - 20061115IS  - 0031-7012 (Print)VI  - 21IP  - 1DP  - 1980TI  - Effect of mercuric chloride on microsomal enzyme system in mouse liver.PG  - 59-63AB  - The effect of mercuric chloride (2 mg/kg) on microsomal enzymes in mouse liver      was investigated in phenobarbital- and 3-methylcholanthrene-induced hepatic      microsomes.

The etiology of these defects       involves hyperproliferation of epithelial cells of the secondary palatal shelf      and ureter, respectively. These effects correlate with altered expression of the       epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and      transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha). In this study, the developmental      toxicity of TCDD was examined in EGF, TGF-alpha, and double EGF + TGF-alpha      knockout (-/-) and wild type (WT) mice. The influence of background genetics in      responsiveness to TCDD was examined using liver 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase      (EROD) activity. Animals were dosed by gavage with 0, 0.2, 1, 5, 24, 50, 100, or       150 micro g TCDD/kg (5 ml/kg) body weight on gestation day 12. The mixed genetic       background of WT, EGF (-/-), and EGF + TGF-alpha (-/-) made these mice less      responsive to TCDD relative to C57BL/6J and TGF-alpha (-/-), which have a C57BL      background. These results show that EGF and TGF-alpha are not required for      response to TCDD; however, the specific ligand available to bind EGFR affects the      responsiveness to TCDD. EGF (-/-) mice are less responsive for CP, but more      sensitive to HN. TGF-alpha (-/-) mice were similar to WT in sensitivity for      induction of CP and HN. The responses of EGF + TGF-alpha (-/-) mice were like the      WT except at higher doses where sensitivity to CP increased, suggesting that the       responses may be mediated by alternative ligands for EGFR that are not functional      equivalents of EGF or TGF-alpha. In conclusion, the EGFR pathway is      mechanistically important in responses of the embryo to TCDD. Specific ligands      confer sensitivity or resistance that are target tissue-dependent.AD  - Reproductive Toxicology Division, National Health and Environmental Effects      Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental      Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, USA.      abbott.barbara@epa.govFAU - Abbott, Barbara DAU  - Abbott BDFAU - Buckalew, Angela RAU  - Buckalew ARFAU - DeVito, Michael JAU  - DeVito MJFAU - Ross, DavidAU  - Ross DFAU - Bryant, P LamontAU  - Bryant PLFAU - Schmid, Judith EAU  - Schmid JELA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - United StatesTA  - Toxicol SciJT  - Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of ToxicologyJID - 9805461RN  - 0 (Environmental Pollutants)RN  - 0 (Teratogens)RN  - 0 (Transforming Growth Factor alpha)RN  - 1746-01-6 (Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin)RN  - 62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)RN  - EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)SB  - IMMH  - Abnormalities, Drug-Induced/*geneticsMH  - Administration, OralMH  - AnimalsMH  - Cleft Palate/chemically induced/embryology/geneticsMH  - Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/biosynthesisMH  - Dose-Response Relationship, DrugMH  - Environmental Pollutants/administration & dosage/*toxicityMH  - Epidermal Growth Factor/*geneticsMH  - FemaleMH  - *Genetic Predisposition to DiseaseMH  - Hydronephrosis/chemically induced/embryology/geneticsMH  - MaleMH  - MiceMH  - Mice, Inbred C57BLMH  - Mice, KnockoutMH  - Microsomes, Liver/drug effects/enzymologyMH  - PregnancyMH  - Teratogens/*toxicityMH  - Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin/administration & dosage/*toxicityMH  - Transforming Growth Factor alpha/*geneticsEDAT- 2003/01/10 04:00MHDA- 2003/06/12 05:00CRDT- 2003/01/10 04:00PST - ppublishSO  - Toxicol Sci. 2003 Jan;71(1):84-95.PMID- 10048155OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19990427DCOM- 19990427LR  - 20061115IS  - 1096-6080 (Print)VI  - 47IP  - 1DP  - 1999 JanTI  - RT-PCR quantification of AHR, ARNT, GR, and CYP1A1 mRNA in craniofacial tissues      of embryonic mice exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and      hydrocortisone.PG  - 76-85AB  - C57BL/6N mouse embryos exposed to hydrocortisone (HC) or      2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) develop cleft palate.

The induction of CYP1A1 mRNA was also       quantified at 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h for control and TCDD-exposed samples.      Total RNA was prepared from midfacial tissue of 4-6 embryos/litter at each time      and dose. An RNA internal standard (IS) for each gene was synthesized, which      included the gene's primer sequences separated by a pUC19 plasmid sequence.      Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on total      RNA + IS using a range of 5-7 IS concentrations across a constant level of total       RNA. PCR products were separated in gels (mRNA and IS-amplified sequences      differed by 30-50 bases), ethidium bromide-stained, imaged (Hamamatsu Photonics      Systems, Bridgewater, NJ), and quantified with NIH Image. CYP1A1 mRNA was      significantly induced in the TCDD-exposed samples at all time points examined (p       = 0.005 at 2 h and 0.001 after 2 h). During palatal shelf outgrowth on GD12, AhR       mRNA levels increased significantly and this was not affected by treatment with      TCDD or HC + TCDD. A significant increase in GR was detected at 24 h (p < 0.05)      and this was unaffected by any of the exposures. Expression of ARNT increased at       12 h (p < 0.001); however, treatment with HC or HC + TCDD blocked this increase      (p < 0.05). At 24 h, the TCDD-treated embryos had significantly lower ARNT mRNA      compared with controls (p < 0.001). The relative overall expression level of the       genes was AhR > ARNT > GR. Within individuals, expression of AhR and/or ARNT was       highly correlated with GR level. In conclusion, CYP1A1 mRNA was expressed in      developing craniofacial tissue and was highly induced by TCDD exposure. AhR,      ARNT, and GR mRNA are upregulated in early palatogenesis, although not on the      same schedule. The TCDD-induced decrease in ARNT at 24 h after dosing and the HC       and HC + TCDD-induced delay in upregulation of ARNT may affect the dynamics of      heterodimer formation between AhR and ARNT. The changes in ARNT mRNA level could       also affect availability of this transcriptional regulator to interact with other      potential partners, and these effects, separately or in combination, may be      involved in disruption of normal embryonic development.AD  - Reproductive Toxicology Division, National Health Effects and Environmental      Research Laboratory, Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park,      North Carolina 27711, USA.FAU - Abbott, B DAU  - Abbott BDFAU - Schmid, J EAU  - Schmid JEFAU - Brown, J GAU  - Brown JGFAU - Wood, C RAU  - Wood CRFAU - White, R DAU  - White RDFAU - Buckalew, A RAU  - Buckalew ARFAU - Held, G AAU  - Held GALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.PL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Toxicol SciJT  - Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of ToxicologyJID - 9805461RN  - 0 (Arnt protein, mouse)RN  - 0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)RN  - 0 (Environmental Pollutants)RN  - 0 (RNA, Messenger)RN  - 0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)RN  - 0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)RN  - 0 (Teratogens)RN  - 0 (Transcription Factors)RN  - 138391-32-9 (Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator)RN  - 1746-01-6 (Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin)RN  - 50-23-7 (Hydrocortisone)RN  - EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)SB  - IMMH  - AnimalsMH  - Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear TranslocatorMH  - Base SequenceMH  - Blotting, NorthernMH  - Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/genetics/*metabolismMH  - *DNA-Binding ProteinsMH  - Environmental Pollutants/*toxicityMH  - FemaleMH  - Hydrocortisone/*toxicityMH  - Maternal-Fetal ExchangeMH  - MiceMH  - Mice, Inbred C57BLMH  - Molecular Sequence DataMH  - Palate/*drug effects/embryology/metabolismMH  - PregnancyMH  - RNA, Messenger/metabolismMH  - Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/genetics/*metabolismMH  - Receptors, Glucocorticoid/genetics/*metabolismMH  - Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain ReactionMH  - Teratogens/*toxicityMH  - Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin/*toxicityMH  - Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolismEDAT- 1999/02/27MHDA- 1999/02/27 00:01CRDT- 1999/02/27 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Toxicol Sci. 1999 Jan;47(1):76-85.PMID- 10048154OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19990427DCOM- 19990427LR  - 20061115IS  - 1096-6080 (Print)VI  - 47IP  - 1DP  - 1999 JanTI  - AhR, ARNT, and CYP1A1 mRNA quantitation in cultured human embryonic palates      exposed to TCDD and comparison with mouse palate in vivo and in culture.PG  - 62-75AB  - 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is developmentally toxic in many      species and induces cleft palate in the C57BL/6N mouse embryo. Palatogenesis in      mouse and human embryos involves homologous processes at the morphological,      cellular, and molecular levels. In organ culture, mouse and human palates respond      similarly to TCDD. The present study quantitates the expression of AhR, ARNT, and      CYP1A1 mRNA in human embryonic palates in organ culture. Palatal tissues were      exposed to 1 x 10(-10), 1 x 10(-9), or 1 x 10(-8) M TCDD or control medium and      sampled at 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours for quantitative RT-PCR using a synthetic RNA      internal standard. Similar measurements of CYP1A1 gene expression were collected       for mouse palates cultured in this model. In human palates, AhR expression      correlated with ARNT and CYP1A1 mRNA expression. TCDD induction of CYP1A1 was      time- and concentration-dependent. The expression of these genes presented a      uniform and continuous distribution across the group of embryos, with no subset      of either high or low expressors/responders. The ratio of AhR to ARNT was      approximately 4:1. AhR mRNA increased during the culture period in both treated      and control subjects; however, ARNT expression was relatively constant. TCDD did       not alter either AhR or ARNT expression in a consistent dose- or time-related      manner. Comparison of human and mouse data showed a high correlation across      species for the induction of CYP1A1. Human embryos expressed approximately 350      times less AhR mRNA than the mouse, and in earlier studies it was shown that      human palates required 200 times more TCDD to produce the same effects. When the       morphological, cellular, and molecular responses to TCDD between mouse and human       are compared, it seems highly unlikely that human embryos could be exposed to      sufficient TCDD to achieve changes in palatal differentiation that would lead to       cleft palate.AD  - Reproductive Toxicology Division, National Health Effects and Environmental      Research Laboratory, Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park,      North Carolina 27711, USA.FAU - Abbott, B DAU  - Abbott BDFAU - Held, G AAU  - Held GAFAU - Wood, C RAU  - Wood CRFAU - Buckalew, A RAU  - Buckalew ARFAU - Brown, J GAU  - Brown JGFAU - Schmid, JAU  - Schmid JLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.PL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Toxicol SciJT  - Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of ToxicologyJID - 9805461RN  - 0 (ARNT protein, human)RN  - 0 (Arnt protein, mouse)RN  - 0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)RN  - 0 (Environmental Pollutants)RN  - 0 (RNA, Messenger)RN  - 0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)RN  - 0 (Teratogens)RN  - 0 (Transcription Factors)RN  - 138391-32-9 (Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator)RN  - 1746-01-6 (Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin)RN  - EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)SB  - IMMH  - AnimalsMH  - Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear TranslocatorMH  - Base SequenceMH  - Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/genetics/*metabolismMH  - *DNA-Binding ProteinsMH  - Dose-Response Relationship, DrugMH  - Environmental Pollutants/*toxicityMH  - HumansMH  - MiceMH  - Mice, Inbred C57BLMH  - Molecular Sequence DataMH  - Organ Culture TechniquesMH  - Palate/*drug effects/embryology/metabolismMH  - RNA, Messenger/metabolismMH  - Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/genetics/*metabolismMH  - Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain ReactionMH  - Teratogens/*toxicityMH  - Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin/*toxicityMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolismEDAT- 1999/02/27MHDA- 1999/02/27 00:01CRDT- 1999/02/27 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Toxicol Sci. 1999 Jan;47(1):62-75.PMID- 6225OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19760901DCOM- 19760901LR  - 20061115IS  - 0090-9556 (Print)VI  - 4IP  - 3DP  - 1976 May-JunTI  - Comparison of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing systems from rats fed crude      and purified diets.PG  - 215-22AB  - Hepatic microsomes from rats fed a crude or a purified diet were compared by      measureing their contents of protein, cytochrome P-450, and cytochrome b5, their       rates of activity of NADPH- and NADH-cytochrome c reductases, NADPH-cytochrome      P-450 reductase, NADPH oxidase, lipid peroxidase, ethylmorphine N-demethylase,      aniline hydroxylase, benzpyrene hydroxylase, and their substrate-binding spectra       (ethylmorphine, hexobarbital, aniline, and ethyl isoyanide). With the exception      of lipid peroxidase activity, which was much higher in microsomes from animals      fed the crude diet, little or no consistent diet-related differences in these      measurements were observed over a 4-week experimental period, nor were results      significantly less variable with one or the other diet. No consistent significant      differences were observed with two strains of rats. The lower lipid peroxidase      activity seen with the purified diet appeared to be due to the high vitamin E      intake when that diet was employed; rats fed the crude diet and an oral      supplement of alpha-tocopherol yielded microsomes with low lipid peroxidase      activities similar to those seen in microsomes from rats fed the purified diet. A      gradual temporal increase in benzpyrene hydroxylase activity was observed with      both diets. This was interpreted to be due to environment inducing agents other      than those present in the diet.FAU - Abbott, VAU  - Abbott VFAU - Deloria, LAU  - Deloria LFAU - Guenthner, TAU  - Guenthner TFAU - Jeffery, EAU  - Jeffery EFAU - Kotake, AAU  - Kotake AFAU - Nerland, DAU  - Nerland DFAU - Mannering, GAU  - Mannering GLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.PL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Drug Metab DisposJT  - Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicalsJID - 9421550RN  - 0 (Cytochromes)RN  - 0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)RN  - 9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)RN  - EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)RN  - EC 1.14.14.1 (Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases)RN  - EC 1.5.3.- (Ethylmorphine-N-Demethylase)RN  - EC 1.6.- (NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases)RN  - EC 1.6.2.- (Cytochrome Reductases)SB  - IMMH  - Analysis of VarianceMH  - AnimalsMH  - Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/metabolismMH  - Binding SitesMH  - Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolismMH  - Cytochrome Reductases/metabolismMH  - Cytochromes/metabolismMH  - DietMH  - Ethylmorphine-N-Demethylase/metabolismMH  - MaleMH  - Microsomes, Liver/*enzymologyMH  - NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/metabolismMH  - Peroxidases/metabolismMH  - Pharmaceutical Preparations/*metabolismMH  - Protein BindingMH  - RatsMH  - Species SpecificityMH  - SpectrophotometryEDAT- 1976/05/01MHDA- 1976/05/01 00:01CRDT- 1976/05/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Drug Metab Dispos. 1976 May-Jun;4(3):215-22.PMID- 112378OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19791024DCOM- 19791024LR  - 20061115IS  - 0026-895X (Print)VI  - 15IP  - 2DP  - 1979 MarTI  - Inhibition of hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenase      reactions by fatty acyl CoA.PG  - 410-8FAU - Abbott, V SAU  - Abbott VSFAU - Mannering, G JAU  - Mannering GJLA  - engPT  - In VitroPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.PL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Mol PharmacolJT  - Molecular pharmacologyJID - 0035623RN  - 0 (Acyl Coenzyme A)RN  - 0 (Peroxides)RN  - 7439-95-4 (Magnesium)RN  - 9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)RN  - EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)RN  - EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)RN  - EC 1.14.14.- (Aniline Hydroxylase)RN  - EC 1.5.3.- (Ethylmorphine-N-Demethylase)RN  - EC 1.6.2.4 (NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase)SB  - IMMH  - Acyl Coenzyme A/*pharmacologyMH  - Aniline Hydroxylase/antagonists & inhibitorsMH  - AnimalsMH  - Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*antagonists & inhibitorsMH  - Ethylmorphine-N-Demethylase/antagonists & inhibitorsMH  - Lipid MetabolismMH  - Magnesium/pharmacologyMH  - MaleMH  - Microsomes, Liver/*enzymologyMH  - Mixed Function Oxygenases/*antagonists & inhibitorsMH  - NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase/metabolismMH  - Oxidoreductases/*antagonists & inhibitorsMH  - Peroxides/metabolismMH  - RatsEDAT- 1979/03/01MHDA- 1979/03/01 00:01CRDT- 1979/03/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Mol Pharmacol. 1979 Mar;15(2):410-8.PMID- 4791043OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19740725DCOM- 19740725LR  - 20061115IS  - 0013-9432 (Print)VI  - 16IP  - 1DP  - 1973TI  - Effect of 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine on degradation of liver haem.PG  - 196-202FAU - Abbritti, GAU  - Abbritti GFAU - De Matteis, FAU  - De Matteis FLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - SWITZERLANDTA  - EnzymeJT  - EnzymeJID - 1262265RN  - 0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)RN  - 0 (Dicarboxylic Acids)RN  - 0 (Levulinic Acids)RN  - 0 (Pyridines)RN  - 14875-96-8 (Heme)RN  - 9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)SB  - IMMH  - AnimalsMH  - Carbon RadioisotopesMH  - Cell FractionationMH  - Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolismMH  - Cytosol/metabolismMH  - Dicarboxylic Acids/pharmacologyMH  - FemaleMH  - Heme/*metabolismMH  - Levulinic Acids/metabolismMH  - Liver/cytology/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolismMH  - MaleMH  - MiceMH  - Microsomes, Liver/metabolismMH  - Mitochondria, Liver/metabolismMH  - Pyridines/*pharmacologyMH  - RatsMH  - Species SpecificityMH  - Stimulation, ChemicalMH  - UltracentrifugationEDAT- 1973/01/01MHDA- 1973/01/01 00:01CRDT- 1973/01/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Enzyme. 1973;16(1):196-202.PMID- 19023539OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20081121DCOM- 20090105IS  - 0253-6269 (Print)VI  - 31IP  - 11DP  - 2008 NovTI  - In vitro inhibitory potential of decursin and decursinol angelate on the      catalytic activity of cytochrome P-450 1A1/2, 2D15, and 3A12 isoforms in canine      hepatic microsomes.PG  - 1425-35AB  - Danggui is one of the most popular herbal medicines consumed by patients in      different clinical settings in Asian countries. In this study, the two major      pyranocoumarin compounds extracted from the Korean Angelica gigas root decursin      (DC) and decursinol angelate (DA) were examined in vitro with regard to their      abilities to inhibit hepatic CYP1A1/2, CYP2D15, and CYP3A12 catalytic activities       in canine liver microsomes. The two components were capable of inhibiting      CYP1A1/2, CYP2D15, and CYP3A12 catalytic activities, but the potencies varied. DC      and DA selectively and noncompetitively inhibited CYP1A1/2 activity, with K ( i )      values of 90.176 and 67.560 microM, respectively. On the other hand, they      exhibited slight inhibitory effects on CYP2D15 and CYP3A12 with K ( i ) values of      666.180 and 872.502 microM, 990.500 and 909.120 microM (1'hydroxymidazolam,      MDZ1'H), and 802.800 and 853.920 microM (4-hydroxymidazolam, MDZ4H),      respectively. Additionally, they showed increased inhibition after preincubation,      which suggests the involvement of a mechanism-based inhibition. In sum, this in      vitro data should be heeded as a signal of possible in vivo interactions. The use      of human liver preparations would considerably strengthen the practical impact of      the data generated from this study.AD  - Department of Veterinary Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Veterinary      Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul 143-701, Republic of Korea.FAU - Abd El-Aty, A MAU  - Abd El-Aty AMFAU - Shah, Syed SherAU  - Shah SSFAU - Kim, Bo-MeeAU  - Kim BMFAU - Choi, Jeong-HeuiAU  - Choi JHFAU - Cho, Hee-JungAU  - Cho HJAU  - Hee-YiFAU - Chang, Byung-JoonAU  - Chang BJFAU - Shin, Ho-ChulAU  - Shin HCFAU - Lee, Kang BongAU  - Lee KBFAU - Shimoda, MinoruAU  - Shimoda MFAU - Shim, Jae-HanAU  - Shim JHLA  - engPT  - In VitroPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20081121PL  - Korea (South)TA  - Arch Pharm ResJT  - Archives of pharmacal researchJID - 8000036RN  - 0 (Benzopyrans)RN  - 0 (Butyric Acids)RN  - 0 (Indicators and Reagents)RN  - 0 (Isoenzymes)RN  - 5928-25-6 (decursin)RN  - 9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)RN  - EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)SB  - IMMH  - AlgorithmsMH  - AnimalsMH  - Benzopyrans/*pharmacologyMH  - Butyric Acids/*pharmacologyMH  - CatalysisMH  - Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolismMH  - DogsMH  - FemaleMH  - Indicators and ReagentsMH  - Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolismMH  - KineticsMH  - Microsomes, Liver/drug effects/*enzymologyMH  - Protein Kinase C/*adverse effectsEDAT- 2008/11/22 09:00MHDA- 2009/01/06 09:00CRDT- 2008/11/22 09:00PHST- 2008/06/02 [received]PHST- 2008/11/03 [accepted]PHST- 2008/11/03 [revised]PHST- 2008/11/21 [aheadofprint]AID - 10.1007/s12272-001-2127-9 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Arch Pharm Res. 2008 Nov;31(11):1425-35.

In situ       production of sex steroids including progesterone have been considered to play      important roles in pathogenesis and/or development of common epithelial ovarian      carcinomas. In this study, StAR, P450scc, and 3beta-HSD were immunolocalized in      100 cases of ovarian carcinoma and results were then correlated with      clinicopathological and prognostic parameters of individual patients including      status of progesterone receptor (PR) in tumor cells. Results of      immunohistochemistry were further characterized by real-time PCR analysis in 20      cases of epithelial ovarian carcinomas in which frozen tissues were available for      examination. StAR, P450scc, and 3beta-HSD immunoreactivity was detected      predominately in the cytoplasm of carcinoma cells. Results of real-time PCR      analysis were correlated with those of immunohistochemical studies. StAR,      P450scc, and 3beta-HSD H scores demonstrated significant inversed statistical      correlation with FIGO stage, residual size of the tumor, and Ki67 LI. A positive       statistically significant correlation was detected between StAR H score and PR-B       LI. Multivariate statistical analysis demonstrated that the status of      intratumoral StAR, FIGO stage, and residual tumor size all turned out to be      independent prognostic factors for the clinical outcome of the patient. The      presence of StAR, a cholesterol transporter for steroidogenesis in human      epithelial ovarian carcinoma, may reflect the ability of these tumors to produce       progesterone in situ that could influence biological behavior of these tumors,      especially through progesterone dependent inhibition of tumor cell proliferation.AD  - Department of Pathology, Tohoku University School of Medicine and Tohoku      University Hospital, 2-1 Seiryo-machi, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Miyagi 980-8575, Japan.      manarpatholo@yahoo.comFAU - Abd-Elaziz, ManarAU  - Abd-Elaziz MFAU - Moriya, TakuyaAU  - Moriya TFAU - Akahira, Jun-ichiAU  - Akahira JFAU - Suzuki, TakashiAU  - Suzuki TFAU - Sasano, HironobuAU  - Sasano HLA  - engPT  - Comparative StudyPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - EnglandTA  - Cancer SciJT  - Cancer scienceJID - 101168776RN  - 0 (Phosphoproteins)RN  - 0 (Receptors, Progesterone)RN  - 0 (Tumor Markers, Biological)RN  - 0 (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein)RN  - 57-83-0 (Progesterone)RN  - EC 1.1.- (17-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases)RN  - EC 1.14.15.6 (Cholesterol Side-Chain Cleavage Enzyme)SB  - IMMH  - 17-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/*metabolismMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Carcinoma/*metabolism/mortality/pathologyMH  - Cholesterol Side-Chain Cleavage Enzyme/*metabolismMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - ImmunohistochemistryMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Ovarian Neoplasms/*metabolism/mortality/pathologyMH  - Phosphoproteins/*metabolismMH  - Progesterone/metabolismMH  - PrognosisMH  - Receptors, Progesterone/metabolismMH  - Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain ReactionMH  - Survival AnalysisMH  - Tumor Markers, Biological/analysisEDAT- 2005/04/12 09:00MHDA- 2005/06/15 09:00CRDT- 2005/04/12 09:00AID - CAS040 [pii]AID - 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2005.00040.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Cancer Sci. 2005 Apr;96(4):232-9.PMID- 18992099OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20090327DCOM- 20090610IS  - 1439-0531 (Electronic)VI  - 44IP  - 2DP  - 2009 AprTI  - Immunohistochemical localization of oestrogen receptors alpha and beta,      progesterone receptor and aromatase in the equine placenta.PG  - 312-9AB  - The functions of placental oestrogens during equine pregnancy are still unclear.       Yet, they may act predominantly as local regulators of growth and differentiation      in the microplacentomes. Thus, expression patterns of oestrogen receptors (ERs)      alpha and beta were investigated in the microcotyledonary placenta from pregnant       mares at 110, 121, 179, 199 and 309 days of gestation by immunohistochemistry. In      microplacentomes, both the ER isoforms were detected in trophoblast (T) cells,      chorionic villous stroma (FS), microcaruncular epithelium (ME) and      microcaruncular stroma (MS). Proportions of positive cells were 38-91% (T),      11-41% (FS), 55-89% (ME), 17-51% (MS) for ERalpha and 66-76% (T), 21-37% (FS),      41-68% (ME) and 24-55% (MS) for ERbeta. Between days 110 and 199, proportions of       cells positive for progesterone receptor (PR) varied between 19% and 62% (T), 3%       and 50% (CS), 15% and 46% (ME), and 4% and 33% (MS). At day 309, PR was virtually      absent in T, CS and ME (percentages < 0.1), whereas in MS 14.3% of cells were      still positive. The expression of ERs and PR in equine microplacentomes gives      evidence for a role of placental steroids as regulators of placental growth,      differentiation and function. The detection of ERalpha, ERbeta and PR in foetal      and maternal vascular tissue suggests that placental steroids are also involved      in the control of placental angiogenesis and /or vascular functions. The      co-localization of ERs with aromatase in T suggests auto- or intracrine functions      of oestrogens in this cell type.AD  - Departments of Anatomy and Histology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Assiut      University, Assiut, Egypt.FAU - Abd-Elnaeim, M M MAU  - Abd-Elnaeim MMFAU - Derar, I RAU  - Derar IRFAU - Wilsher, SAU  - Wilsher SFAU - Allen, W RAU  - Allen WRFAU - Leiser, RAU  - Leiser RFAU - Schuler, GAU  - Schuler GLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tDEP - 20080910PL  - GermanyTA  - Reprod Domest AnimJT  - Reproduction in domestic animals = ZuchthygieneJID - 9015668RN  - 0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)RN  - 0 (Estrogen Receptor beta)RN  - 0 (Estrogens)RN  - 0 (Progestins)RN  - 0 (Receptors, Progesterone)RN  - EC 1.14.14.1 (Aromatase)SB  - IMMH  - AnimalsMH  - Aromatase/*analysisMH  - Chorionic Villi/chemistryMH  - Estrogen Receptor alpha/*analysisMH  - Estrogen Receptor beta/*analysisMH  - Estrogens/physiologyMH  - FemaleMH  - Gestational AgeMH  - Horses/*metabolismMH  - Immunohistochemistry/veterinaryMH  - MaleMH  - Placenta/blood supply/*chemistry/physiologyMH  - PregnancyMH  - Progestins/physiologyMH  - Receptors, Progesterone/*analysisMH  - Trophoblasts/chemistryEDAT- 2008/11/11 09:00MHDA- 2009/06/11 09:00CRDT- 2008/11/11 09:00PHST- 2008/09/10 [aheadofprint]AID - RDA1073 [pii]AID - 10.1111/j.1439-0531.2008.01073.x [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Reprod Domest Anim. 2009 Apr;44(2):312-9.

Ranolazine (875-mg loading dose followed by 500      mg every 12 hours for a total of 4 maintenance doses) was administered to      subjects with mild (n = 8) or moderate (n = 8) hepatic impairment and a matched      control group of healthy volunteers (n = 16). Moderate, but not mild, hepatic      impairment significantly increased ranolazine steady-state area under the      concentration-time curve (AUC0-12) by 76% (P < .001) and maximum plasma      concentration C(max) by 51% (P < .01). The AUC0-12 ratio (metabolite/ranolazine)       decreased for all metabolites in parallel with the degree of hepatic impairment.       AUC0-infinity for the CYP3A substrate midazolam administered as a single dose was      significantly correlated with ranolazine AUC0-12 at steady state (r2 = .33, P <      .001). Over the time interval studied, ranolazine was well tolerated in healthy      subjects and hepatically impaired subjects.AD  - Clinical Pharmacology, CV Therapeutics, Inc, Palo Alto, California, USA.FAU - Abdallah, HishamAU  - Abdallah HFAU - Jerling, MarkusAU  - Jerling MLA  - engPT  - Clinical TrialPT  - Clinical Trial, Phase IPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - United StatesTA  - J Clin PharmacolJT  - Journal of clinical pharmacologyJID - 0366372RN  - 0 (Acetanilides)RN  - 0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)RN  - 0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)RN  - 0 (Piperazines)RN  - 0 (Tablets)RN  - 110445-25-5 (ranolazine)RN  - 59467-70-8 (Midazolam)RN  - 9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)RN  - EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A protein, human)SB  - IMMH  - AcetanilidesMH  - Area Under CurveMH  - Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolismMH  - Delayed-Action PreparationsMH  - Enzyme Inhibitors/blood/*pharmacokineticsMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - Liver Diseases/*metabolismMH  - MaleMH  - Midazolam/administration & dosage/blood/pharmacokineticsMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Piperazines/blood/*pharmacokineticsMH  - TabletsEDAT- 2005/06/14 09:00MHDA- 2005/11/04 09:00CRDT- 2005/06/14 09:00AID - 45/7/802 [pii]AID - 10.1177/0091270005276739 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - J Clin Pharmacol. 2005 Jul;45(7):802-9.PMID- 107681OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19790626DCOM- 19790626LR  - 20061115IS  - 0323-6056 (Print)VI  - 133IP  - 7-8DP  - 1978TI  - Effect of some agents on the activity of cell-free progesterone 11      alpha-hydroxylase and 11 beta-hydroxylase from Aspergillus niger 12Y.PG  - 733-7AB  - The effect of some agents on the activity of cell-free progesterone 11      alpha-hydroxylase and 11 beta-hydroxylase from Aspergillus niger 12Y was studied.      Calcium chloride, sodium chloride, magnesium sulphate, copper sulphate, and EDTA       inhibited 11 alpha-hydroxylase and 11 beta-hydroxylase, while mercuric chloride      inhibited only 11 alpha-hydroxylase.

The constitution of the fermentation medium influenced both the      yield and the type of enzymes catalyzing the transformation of progesterone. The       enzyme yield also varied with the pH value at which induction was performed as      well as with the buffer used. The transformation activity of progesterone was      more pronounced with mycelia induced in citrate-phosphate than in phosphate      buffer. The results demonstrated that induction of 6beta-hydroxylase was favoured      at pH values near neutrality while that of 11alpha-hydroxylase in the presence of      citrate ions. The transformation activity of progesterone was optimal at pH 5.0.       The action of 11alpha-hydroxylase was also optimal at pH 5.0, but other      hydroxylase showed pH optima between 2.2 and 4.0. Progesterone concentrations      higher than 6 mg in 50 ml reaction mixture was a limiting factor for the rate of       transformation activity.FAU - Abdel-Fattah, A FAU  - Abdel-Fattah AFFAU - Sallam, L AAU  - Sallam LAFAU - El-Refai, A HAU  - El-Refai AHFAU - Zeinel-Abdin, AAU  - Zeinel-Abdin ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePL  - HUNGARYTA  - Acta Biol Acad Sci HungJT  - Acta biologica Academiae Scientiarum HungaricaeJID - 0370274RN  - 57-83-0 (Progesterone)RN  - EC 1.14.- (Steroid Hydroxylases)SB  - IMMH  - Aspergillus/*enzymologyMH  - Aspergillus niger/*enzymologyMH  - Enzyme InductionMH  - Hydrogen-Ion ConcentrationMH  - ProgesteroneMH  - Steroid Hydroxylases/*biosynthesisEDAT- 1975/01/01MHDA- 1975/01/01 00:01CRDT- 1975/01/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Acta Biol Acad Sci Hung. 1975;26(1-2):43-9.PMID- 11808821OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20020125DCOM- 20020708LR  - 20071114IS  - 0091-2700 (Print)VI  - 42IP  - 1DP  - 2002 JanTI  - Concordance between tramadol and dextromethorphan parent/metabolite ratios: the      influence of CYP2D6 and non-CYP2D6 pathways on biotransformation.PG  - 24-9AB  - Cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6) activity has been shown to be a determinant of both      the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of tramadol in adults. This study      evaluated the association between CYP2D6 activity, as determined by      dextromethorphan (DM) urinary metabolite ratio, and tramadol biotransformation in      13 children (7-16 years). CYP2D6 genotype was determined by XL-PCR and PCR/RFLP.       Phenotype was assessed by HPLC quantitation of DM and its metabolites from a 12-       to 24-hour urine collection following a single oral dose of DM. There was only a       modest correlation between tramadol/M1 (metabolite 1) plasma concentration or AUC      and the DM/dextrorphan (DX) urinary molar ratio in the study cohort; however,      when subjects were segregated based on the number of functional CYP2D6 alleles, a      much stronger relationship was observed for subjects with two functional alleles,      with essentially no relationship evident in those individuals with one functional      allele. Further evaluation of these data suggested that the CYP2D6-mediated      metabolite (M1) is formed to a lesser extent, and the formation of the non-CYP2D6      product (M2) is more pronounced in subjects with one versus two functional      alleles. Thus, the number of functional CYP2D6 alleles and the availability of      alternative cytochromes P450 capable of metabolizing tramadol may explain the      poor association between DM, a well-characterized CYP2D6 probe, and tramadol in a      population of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.AD  - Department of Pediatrics, University of Missouri-Kansas City, USA.FAU - Abdel-Rahman, S MAU  - Abdel-Rahman SMFAU - Leeder, J SAU  - Leeder JSFAU - Wilson, J TAU  - Wilson JTFAU - Gaedigk, AAU  - Gaedigk AFAU - Gotschall, R RAU  - Gotschall RRFAU - Medve, RAU  - Medve RFAU - Liao, SAU  - Liao SFAU - Spielberg, S PAU  - Spielberg SPFAU - Kearns, G LAU  - Kearns GLLA  - engGR  - 1 U10 HD31313-08/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.PL  - United StatesTA  - J Clin PharmacolJT  - Journal of clinical pharmacologyJID - 0366372RN  - 0 (Analgesics, Opioid)RN  - 0 (Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists)RN  - 125-71-3 (Dextromethorphan)RN  - 27203-92-5 (Tramadol)RN  - EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6)SB  - IMMH  - AdolescentMH  - Analgesics, Opioid/*blood/chemistryMH  - Area Under CurveMH  - Biotransformation/geneticsMH  - ChildMH  - Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*genetics/*metabolismMH  - Dextromethorphan/chemistry/*urineMH  - Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/chemistry/urineMH  - HumansMH  - Least-Squares AnalysisMH  - Pilot ProjectsMH  - Tramadol/*blood/chemistryEDAT- 2002/01/26 10:00MHDA- 2002/07/09 10:01CRDT- 2002/01/26 10:00PST - ppublishSO  - J Clin Pharmacol. 2002 Jan;42(1):24-9.PMID- 10383919OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19990720DCOM- 19990720LR  - 20071114IS  - 0090-9556 (Print)VI  - 27IP  - 7DP  - 1999 JulTI  - Potent inhibition of cytochrome P-450 2D6-mediated dextromethorphan      O-demethylation by terbinafine.PG  - 770-5AB  - Cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 2D6 is responsible for the biotransformation of over 35      pharmacologic agents. In the process of studying CYP2D6 we identified      phenotype-genotype discordance in two individuals receiving terbinafine. This      prompted evaluation of the potential for terbinafine to inhibit CYP2D6 in vitro.       Human hepatic microsomes and heterologously expressed CYP2D6 were incubated with       terbinafine or quinidine and the formation of dextrorphan from dextromethorphan      was determined by HPLC. Additionally, preliminary conformational analyses were      conducted to determine the fit of terbinafine into a previously described      pharmacophore model for CYP2D6 inhibitors. The apparent Km and Vmax of      dextrorphan formation from four human hepatic microsome samples ranged from 5.8      to 6.8 microM and from 172 to 300 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. Values of Km      and Vmax in the heterologously expressed CYP2D6 system averaged 6.5 +/- 2.1      microM and 1342 +/- 147 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. Terbinafine inhibited       dextromethorphan O-demethylation with an apparent Ki ranging from 28 to 44 nM in       human hepatic microsomes and averaging 22.4 +/- 0.6 nM for the heterologously      expressed enzymes. Results of quinidine in these systems produced values for Ki      ranging from 18 to 43 nM. Such strong inhibition of CYP2D6 by terbinafine would      not have been predicted by the previously proposed pharmacophore model of CYP2D6       inhibitors based on molecular structure. Terbinafine is a potent inhibitor of      CYP2D6 with apparent Ki values well below plasma and tissue concentrations      typically achieved during a therapeutic course. This agent needs to be evaluated       in vivo to determine the impact of CYP2D6 inhibition by terbinafine on the      metabolism of concomitantly administered CYP2D6 substrates.AD  - Section of Pediatric Clinical Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, The      Children's Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, Missouri 64108, USA. srahman@cmh.eduFAU - Abdel-Rahman, S MAU  - Abdel-Rahman SMFAU - Marcucci, KAU  - Marcucci KFAU - Boge, TAU  - Boge TFAU - Gotschall, R RAU  - Gotschall RRFAU - Kearns, G LAU  - Kearns GLFAU - Leeder, J SAU  - Leeder JSLA  - engGR  - 1UO1 HD 31313-06/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.PL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Drug Metab DisposJT  - Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicalsJID - 9421550RN  - 0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)RN  - 0 (Naphthalenes)RN  - 125-71-3 (Dextromethorphan)RN  - 91161-71-6 (terbinafine)RN  - EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6)SB  - IMMH  - Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolismMH  - Dextromethorphan/*pharmacokineticsMH  - Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacologyMH  - HumansMH  - MethylationMH  - Microsomes, Liver/drug effects/enzymologyMH  - Models, MolecularMH  - Naphthalenes/*pharmacologyEDAT- 1999/06/29MHDA- 1999/06/29 00:01CRDT- 1999/06/29 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Drug Metab Dispos. 1999 Jul;27(7):770-5.PMID- 10340911OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19990527DCOM- 19990527LR  - 20071114IS  - 0009-9236 (Print)VI  - 65IP  - 5DP  - 1999 MayTI  - Investigation of terbinafine as a CYP2D6 inhibitor in vivo.PG  - 465-72AB  - BACKGROUND: Terbinafine is an orally active antifungal used in the treatment of      dermatophytoses. To date, studies evaluating the effect of terbinafine on the      cytochromes P450 have failed to show any significant interactions. This      prospective open-label study was designed to confirm our previous finding that      terbinafine may inhibit CYP2D6. METHODS: Nine healthy volunteers were enrolled in      this study-6 genotypically consistent with an extensive metabolizer phenotype and      3 genotypic poor metabolizers for CYP2D6. The change in CYP2D6 enzyme activity      before (x 3) and after (monthly x 6 months) administration of terbinafine (250 mg      once daily x 14 days) was evaluated with the dextromethorphan to dextrorphan      urinary metabolite ratios. On each study day a predose urine sample was      collected, 0.3 mg/kg dextromethorphan was administered, and urine was collected      for 24 hours. Dextromethorphan and its metabolites were quantified from urine by       HPLC. RESULTS: Baseline phenotype values were concordant with individual      genotype. In all extensive metabolizers, the administration of terbinafine      resulted in a dramatic increase in the dextromethorphan/dextrorphan ratio,      converting 4 of the 6 extensive metabolizers into phenotypic poor metabolizers.      On average, a 97-fold increase in ratio (range, 35 to 265) was observed for      extensive metabolizers after the administration of terbinafine. No significant      change was observed in the metabolite ratios of poor metabolizers during the      course of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Terbinafine inhibits CYP2D6 sufficiently to      produce a discordance between genotype and phenotype for the enzyme. The      dextromethorphan/dextrorphan metabolite ratios increased in all individuals, with      otherwise functional CYP2D6 activity. The disposition of CYP2D6 substrates      coadministered with terbinafine may be significantly altered in extensive      metabolizers for this cytochrome P450 isoform, who comprise approximately 93% of       the population.AD  - Children's Mercy Hospital, and the Department of Pediatrics, Pharmacy Practice,      Pharmacology, and the Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Missouri-Kansas      City, 64108, USA. srahman@cmh.eduFAU - Abdel-Rahman, S MAU  - Abdel-Rahman SMFAU - Gotschall, R RAU  - Gotschall RRFAU - Kauffman, R EAU  - Kauffman REFAU - Leeder, J SAU  - Leeder JSFAU - Kearns, G LAU  - Kearns GLLA  - engGR  - 1U01 HD 31313-06/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Clinical TrialPT  - Controlled Clinical TrialPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.PL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Clin Pharmacol TherJT  - Clinical pharmacology and therapeuticsJID - 0372741RN  - 0 (Antifungal Agents)RN  - 0 (Antitussive Agents)RN  - 0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)RN  - 0 (Naphthalenes)RN  - 125-71-3 (Dextromethorphan)RN  - 125-73-5 (Dextrorphan)RN  - 1531-25-5 (3-methoxymorphinan)RN  - 91161-71-6 (terbinafine)RN  - EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6)SB  - AIMSB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - Antifungal Agents/*pharmacologyMH  - Antitussive Agents/administration & dosage/urineMH  - Chromatography, High Pressure LiquidMH  - Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*antagonists & inhibitorsMH  - Dextromethorphan/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/urineMH  - Dextrorphan/urineMH  - Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacologyMH  - FemaleMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Naphthalenes/*pharmacologyMH  - PhenotypeMH  - Prospective StudiesMH  - Reference ValuesMH  - Voluntary WorkersEDAT- 1999/05/26MHDA- 1999/05/26 00:01CRDT- 1999/05/26 00:00AID - S0009923699000478 [pii]AID - 10.1016/S0009-9236(99)70065-2 [doi]PST - ppublishSO  - Clin Pharmacol Ther. 1999 May;65(5):465-72.PMID- 10803680OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20000713DCOM- 20000713LR  - 20081121IS  - 0960-314X (Print)VI  - 10IP  - 3DP  - 2000 AprTI  - Role of polymorphic CYP2E1 and CYP2D6 genes in NNK-induced chromosome aberrations      in cultured human lymphocytes.PG  - 239-49AB  - Polymorphisms in genes of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes are largely responsible      for interindividual differences in ability to activate and detoxify genotoxic      agents and therefore may influence individual susceptibility to environmental      cancer. The tobacco-specific nitrosamine,      4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), requires metabolic      activation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes to generate DNA-reactive      intermediates that induce mutations and cancer. In the current study, we      investigated the role of the polymorphic CYP2E1 and CYP2D6 genes in the      genotoxicity of NNK using the tandem-probe fluorescence in-situ hybridization      (FISH) chromosome aberration assay as a marker. Our results, using whole blood      cultures from 39 volunteers, indicated that NNK (0.12, 0.24 or 0.72 mM) induced a      concentration-dependent increase in the frequency of chromosome aberration. The      potential role of CYP2E1 and CYP2D6 in NNK-induced genetic damage in cultured      human lymphocytes was characterized using specific CYP inhibitors. Treatment of      blood cultures with 25 microM diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), a specific CYP2E1      inhibitor, or 0.5 microM quinidine, a specific CYP2D6 inhibitor, simultaneously      with NNK, significantly decreased NNK-induced chromosome aberration. We also      studied the role of CYP2E1 and CYP2D6 allelic variants on NNK-induced chromosome       aberration. Our results indicate that NNK induced a significantly higher level of      chromosome aberration in cells with the CYP2E1 WT/*5B genotype compared to cells       with the CYP2E1 WT/WT. In contrast, no difference in NNK-induced chromosome      aberration was observed between cells with the CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers      compared to cells with the CYP2D6 poor metabolizer genotypes. These results      underscore the important role of polymorphic metabolizing genes in influencing      the genotoxic responses to environmental mutagens and provide support to the      reported findings linking CYP2E1 polymorphism to smoking-related lung cancer.AD  - Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health, The University of Texas      Medical Branch, Galveston 77555-1110, USA. sabdelra@utmb.eduFAU - Abdel-Rahman, S ZAU  - Abdel-Rahman SZFAU - Salama, S AAU  - Salama SAFAU - Au, W WAU  - Au WWFAU - Hamada, F AAU  - Hamada FALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - ENGLANDTA  - PharmacogeneticsJT  - PharmacogeneticsJID - 9211735RN  - 0 (Carcinogens)RN  - 0 (Nitrosamines)RN  - 64091-91-4 (4-(N-methyl-N-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone)RN  - EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6)RN  - EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AllelesMH  - Carcinogenicity TestsMH  - Carcinogens/metabolism/*toxicityMH  - Cells, CulturedMH  - *Chromosome AberrationsMH  - Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/antagonists & inhibitors/*geneticsMH  - Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1/antagonists & inhibitors/*geneticsMH  - Genetic Predisposition to DiseaseMH  - Genetic VariationMH  - HumansMH  - In Situ Hybridization, FluorescenceMH  - Lymphocytes/drug effectsMH  - Neoplasms/etiologyMH  - Nitrosamines/metabolism/*toxicityMH  - Smoking/adverse effectsEDAT- 2000/05/10 09:00MHDA- 2000/07/15 11:00CRDT- 2000/05/10 09:00PST - ppublishSO  - Pharmacogenetics. 2000 Apr;10(3):239-49.PMID- 18372530OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20080331DCOM- 20080520IS  - 0304-3835 (Print)VI  - 119IP  - 1DP  - 1997 Oct 28TI  - The CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer genotype is associated with increased risk for      bladder cancer.PG  - 115-22AB  - Inheritance of certain polymorphic metabolizing genes is associated with the      development of a number of environmental cancers and may also influence the      clinicopathological tumor outcome. We have investigated the association between      the inheritance of the polymorphic cytochrome P-450 2D6 (CYP2D6) gene and the      development of transitional and squamous cell carcinomas (TCC and SCC) of the      bladder in 37 Egyptian cancer patients and 27 matched controls. Genotypic      analysis using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the restriction fragment      length polymorphism (RFLP) assays revealed that the CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer       genotype (CYP2D6*1A) is over represented in bladder cancer patients compared to      controls (79 versus 44%, respectively) and is significantly associated with      increased risk for bladder cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 4.5, 95% confidence limit      (CL) = 1.3-15.7, P = 0.006). Our results also indicate that individuals who have       inherited this genotype are more likely to develop TCC (OR = 5.9, 95% CL =      1.4-27.9, P = 0.006) rather than SCC (OR = 3.1, 95% CL = 0.7-15.9; P = 0.09).      When the relative risk associated with this genotype was estimated among subjects      who were smokers or schistosoma infected, the same tendency towards the      development of TCC was observed. These data suggest that the predisposing CYP2D6       gene may not only increase the risk for bladder cancer among Egyptians, but may      also influence the clinicopathological tumor outcome.AD  - Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health, The University of Texas      Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555-1110, USA.FAU - Abdel-Rahman, S ZAU  - Abdel-Rahman SZFAU - Anwar, W AAU  - Anwar WAFAU - Abdel-Aal, W EAU  - Abdel-Aal WEFAU - Ghoneim, M AAU  - Ghoneim MAFAU - Au, W WAU  - Au WWLA  - engGR  - P30 ES 06676/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United StatesPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, N.I.H., ExtramuralPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPT  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.PL  - IrelandTA  - Cancer LettJT  - Cancer lettersJID - 7600053RN  - EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6)SB  - IMMH  - Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*genetics/parasitologyMH  - Carcinoma, Transitional Cell/*genetics/parasitologyMH  - Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*geneticsMH  - EgyptMH  - FemaleMH  - *Genetic Predisposition to DiseaseMH  - GenotypeMH  - HumansMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Polymerase Chain ReactionMH  - Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment LengthMH  - Risk FactorsMH  - Schistosomiasis/complicationsMH  - Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*genetics/parasitologyEDAT- 2008/04/01 09:00MHDA- 2008/05/21 09:00CRDT- 2008/04/01 09:00AID - S0304-3835(97)00265-6 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Cancer Lett. 1997 Oct 28;119(1):115-22.PMID- 15345327OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 20040903DCOM- 20041103LR  - 20081121IS  - 0006-2952 (Print)VI  - 68IP  - 7DP  - 2004 Oct 1TI  - Determination of interleukin-4-responsive region in the human cytochrome P450 2E1      gene promoter.PG  - 1371-81AB  - Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) gene expression is known to be induced by      interleukin-4 (IL4) and repressed by inflammatory cytokines, such as      interleukin-1beta3 (IL1beta3) in human hepatocytes. The mechanisms involved in      these transcriptional regulations remain elusive. In order to study these      mechanisms, various constructs of the human CYP2E1 promoter were prepared and      transfected into the human HepG2 hepatoma cell line. Our findings revealed that      an IL4-responsive region of 128bp (-671/-544) was required to mediate induction      by IL4. IL1beta caused moderate but significant decrease of the promoter      activity, which was abolished when the two cytokines were combined. The IL1beta      inhibitory effect is mediated through a regulatory sequence independent of that      of IL4. Furthermore, by using specific signaling pathway inhibitors, we      demonstrated that IL4 activation required protein kinase C (PKC) activation. In      addition, our results suggest that induction by IL4 was not dependent on a single      binding site but rather on a complex region which includes putative binding sites      for signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)6, activator protein      (AP)-1, nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkappaB), nuclear factor of activated T cells      (NFAT) and CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP). Electrophoretic mobility shift      assays suggest that AP1 and NFAT transcription factors are able to bind to three       sites in the IL4-responsive region.AD  - Faculty of Sciences I, Lebanese University, BP14/6573, Lebanon.FAU - Abdel-Razzak, ZiadAU  - Abdel-Razzak ZFAU - Garlatti, MicheleAU  - Garlatti MFAU - Aggerbeck, MartineAU  - Aggerbeck MFAU - Barouki, RobertAU  - Barouki RLA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - EnglandTA  - Biochem PharmacolJT  - Biochemical pharmacologyJID - 0101032RN  - 0 (Drug Combinations)RN  - 0 (Interleukin-1)RN  - 0 (Nuclear Proteins)RN  - 0 (Transcription Factors)RN  - 207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)RN  - 9007-49-2 (DNA)RN  - EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1)SB  - IMMH  - Base SequenceMH  - Binding SitesMH  - Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1/*genetics/metabolismMH  - DNA/analysisMH  - Dose-Response Relationship, DrugMH  - Drug CombinationsMH  - Gene Expression/drug effectsMH  - HumansMH  - Interleukin-1/pharmacologyMH  - Interleukin-4/*pharmacologyMH  - Molecular Sequence DataMH  - Nuclear Proteins/metabolismMH  - Promoter Regions, Genetic/*drug effects/geneticsMH  - Response Elements/*drug effects/geneticsMH  - Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiologyMH  - Transcription FactorsMH  - Tumor Cells, CulturedEDAT- 2004/09/04 05:00MHDA- 2004/11/04 09:00CRDT- 2004/09/04 05:00PHST- 2004/03/15 [received]PHST- 2004/06/04 [accepted]AID - 10.1016/j.bcp.2004.06.003 [doi]AID - S0006295204004101 [pii]PST - ppublishSO  - Biochem Pharmacol. 2004 Oct 1;68(7):1371-81.PMID- 7789536OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19950721DCOM- 19950721LR  - 20061115IS  - 0014-5793 (Print)VI  - 366IP  - 2-3DP  - 1995 Jun 12TI  - Interleukin-1 beta antagonizes phenobarbital induction of several major      cytochromes P450 in adult rat hepatocytes in primary culture.PG  - 159-64AB  - We have investigated the effects of interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL6 on expression      and phenobarbital (PB) induction of ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and      pentoxyresorufin O-deethylase (PROD) activities, as well as on mRNA levels of      cytochromes P450 (CYP) 1A, 2B, 2C, 2E and 3A, in rat hepatocytes in primary      culture. IL6 slightly antagonized PB-induced PROD activity. Strikingly, IL1 beta       strongly inhibited basal EROD and PROD activities, and fully blocked their      induction by PB in a dose-dependent fashion. Furthermore IL1 beta completely      suppressed PB induction of all CYP mRNAs analyzed.

Most cytokines that were previously found to decrease basal CYP      expression could counteract PAH induction of CYP1A mRNA and its associated      ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylation (EROD) activity. IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha blocked      3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC)-induced EROD activity by up to 25 and 44%,      respectively. IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma antagonized EROD induction by up to 61 and       70%, respectively. TGF-beta 1 proved to be the most effective cytokine, because      72 hr of treatment with 2 ng/ml TGF-beta 1 produced nearly 100% inhibition of      3-MC- and benzo(a)pyrene-induced CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNAs and EROD activity.      Treatment with cycloheximide in combination with 3-MC led to superinduction of      CYP1A mRNA, under which conditions TGF-beta 1 did not block induction, suggesting      the requirement for protein synthesis for the suppressive effect of the cytokine.      In addition, TGF-beta 1 augmented AP-1-binding activity, suggesting that fos      and/or jun protooncogene products could be implicated in the response. Our      results demonstrate that IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IFNs antagonized PAH-mediated       induction of CYP1A gene expression in human hepatocytes. In addition, we report      the finding of a novel effect of TGF-beta 1, which was able to prevent CYP1A1 and      -1A2 induction by two different PAHs.AD  - INSERM U 49, Hopital de Pontchaillou, Rennes, France.FAU - Abdel-Razzak, ZAU  - Abdel-Razzak ZFAU - Corcos, LAU  - Corcos LFAU - Fautrel, AAU  - Fautrel AFAU - Campion, J PAU  - Campion JPFAU - Guillouzo, AAU  - Guillouzo ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Mol PharmacolJT  - Molecular pharmacologyJID - 0035623RN  - 0 (Cytokines)RN  - 0 (Nuclear Proteins)RN  - 0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)RN  - 0 (RNA, Messenger)RN  - 0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)RN  - 0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)RN  - 50-32-8 (Benzo(a)pyrene)RN  - 56-49-5 (Methylcholanthrene)RN  - 66-81-9 (Cycloheximide)RN  - 9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)RN  - EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)RN  - EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)RN  - EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2)SB  - IMGS  - CYP1AMH  - AdultMH  - Amino Acid SequenceMH  - Base SequenceMH  - Benzo(a)pyrene/*pharmacologyMH  - Cells, CulturedMH  - Cycloheximide/pharmacologyMH  - Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1MH  - Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2MH  - Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*biosynthesis/metabolismMH  - Cytokines/*physiologyMH  - Dose-Response Relationship, DrugMH  - Down-RegulationMH  - Enzyme Induction/drug effectsMH  - HumansMH  - KineticsMH  - Liver/cytology/drug effects/*enzymologyMH  - Methylcholanthrene/*pharmacologyMH  - Molecular Sequence DataMH  - Nuclear Proteins/metabolismMH  - OligodeoxyribonucleotidesMH  - Oxidoreductases/*biosynthesis/metabolismMH  - RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolismMH  - Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolismMH  - Transcription, GeneticMH  - Transforming Growth Factor beta/*physiologyEDAT- 1994/12/01MHDA- 1994/12/01 00:01CRDT- 1994/12/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Mol Pharmacol. 1994 Dec;46(6):1100-10.PMID- 8232220OWN - NLMSTAT- MEDLINEDA  - 19931129DCOM- 19931129LR  - 20061115IS  - 0026-895X (Print)VI  - 44IP  - 4DP  - 1993 OctTI  - Cytokines down-regulate expression of major cytochrome P-450 enzymes in adult      human hepatocytes in primary culture.PG  - 707-15AB  - Cytokines are thought to cause the depression of cytochrome P-450      (CYP)-associated drug metabolism in humans during inflammation and infection. We       have examined the role of five cytokines, i.e., interleukin-1 beta,      interleukin-4, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma,       on the expression of CYP1A2, CYP2C, CYP2E1, CYP3A, and epoxide hydrolase in      primary human hepatocyte cultures. Steady state P-450 and epoxide hydrolase mRNA       levels, as well as ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and nifedipine oxidation      activities, which are mainly supported by CYP1A1/1A2 and CYP3A, respectively,      were measured. Interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha      were found to be the most potent depressors of P-450 enzymes. After 3 days of      treatment, both mRNA levels and enzyme activities were depressed, typically by at      least 40%, whatever the cytokine and the enzyme considered. Interferon-gamma also      suppressed CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 mRNA levels and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase      activity but had no effect on CYP3A and epoxide hydrolase mRNAs. In addition,      interleukin-4 had the opposite effect, compared with other cytokines, on CYP2E1      mRNA, which was increased up to 5-fold; ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and      nifedipine oxidation activities were not significantly affected. These results      provide the first demonstration that various cytokines act directly on human      hepatocytes to affect expression of major P-450 genes and that a wide range of      responses can be observed among the enzymes for a given cytokine, suggesting that      different regulatory mechanisms may be involved.AD  - INSERM U 49, Hopital de Pontchaillou, Rennes, France.FAU - Abdel-Razzak, ZAU  - Abdel-Razzak ZFAU - Loyer, PAU  - Loyer PFAU - Fautrel, AAU  - Fautrel AFAU - Gautier, J CAU  - Gautier JCFAU - Corcos, LAU  - Corcos LFAU - Turlin, BAU  - Turlin BFAU - Beaune, PAU  - Beaune PFAU - Guillouzo, AAU  - Guillouzo ALA  - engPT  - Journal ArticlePT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tPL  - UNITED STATESTA  - Mol PharmacolJT  - Molecular pharmacologyJID - 0035623RN  - 0 (Cytokines)RN  - 0 (Interferon-gamma, Recombinant)RN  - 0 (Interleukin-1)RN  - 0 (Interleukin-6)RN  - 0 (RNA, Messenger)RN  - 0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)RN  - 207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)RN  - 9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)RN  - EC 3.3.2.3 (Epoxide Hydrolases)SB  - IMMH  - AdultMH  - AgedMH  - Cells, CulturedMH  - Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*genetics/*metabolismMH  - Cytokines/*pharmacologyMH  - Depression, ChemicalMH  - Down-Regulation/*drug effects/physiologyMH  - Epoxide Hydrolases/genetics/metabolismMH  - FemaleMH  - Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects/physiologyMH  - HumansMH  - Interferon-gamma, Recombinant/pharmacologyMH  - Interleukin-1/pharmacologyMH  - Interleukin-4/pharmacologyMH  - Interleukin-6/pharmacologyMH  - Liver/*cytology/*enzymology/physiologyMH  - MaleMH  - Middle AgedMH  - Models, BiologicalMH  - RNA, Messenger/geneticsMH  - Time FactorsMH  - Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacologyEDAT- 1993/10/01MHDA- 1993/10/01 00:01CRDT- 1993/10/01 00:00PST - ppublishSO  - Mol Pharmacol. 1993 Oct;44(4):707-15.
