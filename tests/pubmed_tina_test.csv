Although endocrine regulationof growth and sexual maturation is a significant issue in general pediatrics,disorders of energy production and utilization, fluid and electrolyte balance,and circulatory function are the endocrine causes of critical illness inchildren. Care of the child with critical endocrine disease requires anunderstanding of endocrine pathophysiology, keen history taking and assessmentskills, and knowledge of the pharmacology of synthetic hormone treatment.
