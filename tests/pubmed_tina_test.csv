Cortisol is essential for general adaptation to stress and playsa crucial role in cardiovascular, metabolic, and immunologic homeostasis. Duringcritical illness, prolonged activation of the HPA axis can result inhypercortisolemia and hypocortisolemia; both can be detrimental to recovery fromcritical illness. Recognition of adrenal dysfunction in critically ill patientsis difficult because a reliable history is not available and laboratory resultsare difficult to interpret.

"7","16462406","AACN clinical issues","Morton PG","One of the most debilitating neurological complications of human immunodeficiencyvirus (HIV), affecting nearly one in three patients, is painful peripheralneuropathy. Although HIV infection can cause distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSP),the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to treat HIV infectionhas resulted in a significant number of patients developing a clinicallyindistinguishable form of toxic neuropathy. The predominant symptom, regardlessof etiology, is excruciating unremitting pain, resistant to pharmacologicaltreatments, that leads to a reduction in the ability to conduct activities ofdaily living and, eventually, inability to ambulate. Since withdrawal fromnucleoside therapy is not typically recommended, a more thorough understanding ofthe etiology and pathophysiology underlying nucleoside-induced peripheralneuropathy, through basic and clinical research endeavors, will aid in thedevelopment of new therapeutic treatments aimed at alleviating or amelioratingpain. This article provides the latest information regarding the pathophysiologyand clinical implications of HIV peripheral neuropathy.","16462406","16462406","","key1 key2"

Twenty-four subjects were grouped according to their Child-Pugh scoreas healthy, with mild hepatic impairment or with moderate hepatic impairment. Thesubjects were administered a single oral dose of escitalopram 20 mg, and bloodwas sampled up to 168 hours after dosage. The serum concentration of escitalopramwas determined and the pharmacokinetics assessed by nonlinear mixed effectmodeling. The CYP2C19 activity was measured from the urinary excretion ratio ofS/R-mephenytoin. All subjects tolerated the treatment well, and no seriousadverse events were reported. Predicted mean area under the curve from zero toinfinity (AUC(inf)) values were 51% and 69% higher for patients with mild andmoderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification), respectively, comparedwith healthy subjects. The best-fitting model showed an influence of CYP2C19activity on clearance and body weight on the volume of distribution forescitalopram.

The present study determined theability of the analogs to inhibit NIC-evoked (86)Rb(+) efflux from rat thalamicsynaptosomes to assess functional interaction with alpha4beta2* nAChRs. In aconcentration-dependent manner, NIC evoked (86)Rb(+) efflux (EC(50) = 170nmol/L). Analog-induced inhibition of NIC-evoked (86)Rb(+) efflux varied over aapproximately 450-fold range. Analogs with long n-alkyl chain lengths(C(9)-C(12)) inhibited efflux in the low nmol/L range (IC(50) = 9-20 nmol/L),similar to dihydro-beta-erythroidine (IC(50) = 19 nmol/L). Compounds with shortern-alkyl chain lengths (C(1)-C(8)) produced inhibition in the low micromol/L range(IC(50) = 3-12 micromol/L). C(10) and C(12) analogs completely inhibitedNIC-evoked efflux, whereas C(1-9) analogs produced maximal inhibition of only 10%to 60%. While the C(10) analog N-n-decylnicotinium iodide (NDNI) did not producesignificant inhibition of NIC-evoked dopamine release in previously reportedstudies, NDNI possesses high affinity for [(3)H]NIC binding sites (K(i) = 90nmol/L) and is a potent and efficacious inhibitor of NIC-evoked (86)Rb(+) effluxas demonstrated in the current studies. Thus, NDNI is a competitive, selectiveantagonist at alpha4beta2* nAChRs.","16594645","16594645","1990-06-07","key1 key2"
"7","16594644","The AAPS journal","Uetrecht J","Drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs) are a major problem, in large partbecause of their unpredictable nature. If we understood the mechanisms of thesereactions better, they might be predictable. Their unpredictable nature alsomakes mechanistic studies very difficult, especially prospective clinicalstudies. Animal models are vital to most biomedical research, and they are almostthe only way to test basic hypotheses of DHRs, such as the involvement ofreactive metabolites. However, useful animal models of DHRs are rare because DHRsare also unpredictable in animals. For example, sulfonamide-induced DHRs inlarge-breed dogs appear to be valid because they are very similar to the DHRsthat occur in humans; however, the incidence is only approximately 0.25%, andlarge-breed dogs are difficult to use as an animal model. Two more practicalmodels are penicillamine-induced autoimmunity in the Brown Norway rat andnevirapine-induced skin rash in rats. The toxicity in these models is clearlyimmune mediated. In other models, such as amodiaquine-inducedagranulocytosis/hepatotoxicity and halothane-induced hepatotoxicity, the druginduces an immune response but there is no clinical toxicity. This findingsuggests that regulatory mechanisms usually limit toxicity. Many of the basiccharacteristics of the penicillamine and nevirapine models, such as memory andtolerance, are quite different suggesting that the mechanisms are alsosignificantly different. More animal models are needed to study the range ofmechanisms involved in DHRs; without them, progress in understanding suchreactions is likely to be slow.","16594644","16594644","1997-03-30","key1 key2"

The influence ofprocess variables related to the emulsification step and microsphere recoveringand formulation variables, such as alginate gelation and chitosan coating, on thesize distribution and encapsulation efficiency was studied. The effect ofmicrosphere coating as well its drying procedure on the Hb release profile wasalso evaluated. Chitosan coating was applied by either a continuousmicroencapsulation procedure or a 2-stage coating process. Microspheres with amean diameter of less than 30 microm and an encapsulation efficiency above 90%were obtained. Calcium alginate cross-linking was optimized by using anacid/CaCO(3) molar ratio of 2.5, and microsphere-recovery with acetate buffer ledto higher encapsulation efficiency. Hb release in gastric fluid was minimal forair-dried microspheres. Coating effect revealed a total release of 27% for2-stage coated wet microspheres, while other formulations showed an Hb releaseabove 50%. Lyophilized microspheres behaved similar to wet microspheres, althougha higher total protein release was obtained with 2-stage coating. At pH 6.8,uncoated microspheres dissolved in less than 1 hour; however, Hb release fromair-dried microspheres was incomplete. Chitosan coating decreased the releaserate of Hb, but an incomplete release was obtained. The 2-stage coatedmicrospheres showed no burst effect, whereas the 1-stage coated microspherespermitted a higher protein release.","16594643","16594643","1980-04-04","key1 key2"
