If we understood the mechanisms of thesereactions better, they might be predictable. Their unpredictable nature alsomakes mechanistic studies very difficult, especially prospective clinicalstudies. Animal models are vital to most biomedical research, and they are almostthe only way to test basic hypotheses of DHRs, such as the involvement ofreactive metabolites. However, useful animal models of DHRs are rare because DHRsare also unpredictable in animals. For example, sulfonamide-induced DHRs inlarge-breed dogs appear to be valid because they are very similar to the DHRsthat occur in humans; however, the incidence is only approximately 0.25%, andlarge-breed dogs are difficult to use as an animal model. Two more practicalmodels are penicillamine-induced autoimmunity in the Brown Norway rat andnevirapine-induced skin rash in rats. The toxicity in these models is clearlyimmune mediated. In other models, such as amodiaquine-inducedagranulocytosis/hepatotoxicity and halothane-induced hepatotoxicity, the druginduces an immune response but there is no clinical toxicity. This findingsuggests that regulatory mechanisms usually limit toxicity. Many of the basiccharacteristics of the penicillamine and nevirapine models, such as memory andtolerance, are quite different suggesting that the mechanisms are alsosignificantly different. More animal models are needed to study the range ofmechanisms involved in DHRs; without them, progress in understanding suchreactions is likely to be slow.",16594644,16594644

Evidence is mounting thatproducts of the immune system, such as chemokines, can reciprocally alter theactions of these drugs and the endogenous ligands for their receptors. Chemokinesare a family of small (8 to 12 kDa) proteins involved in cellular migration andintercellular communication. With a few exceptions, they act on more than onereceptor. Although the chemokines and their G protein-coupled receptors arelocated in both glia and neurons throughout the brain, they are not uniformlydistributed. They are found in such brain areas as the hypothalamus, nucleusaccumbens, limbic system, hippocampus, thalamus, cortex, and cerebellum. Amongthe chemokines differentially localized in brain neurons and glia are CCL2/MCP-1,CXCL12/SDF-1alpha, CX3CL1/fractalkine, CXCL10/IP 10, CCL3/MIP-1alpha, andCCL5/RANTES. Functional roles for the chemokine system, composed of the chemokineligands and their receptors, have been suggested in brain development andheterologous desensitization. The system can alter the actions of neuronallyactive pharmacological agents such as opioids and cannabinoids and interact withneurotransmitter systems.

We briefly review how animal models can aid substantially inclarifying the developmental risk of exposure to solvents for adversebiobehavioral outcomes following abuse patterns of use and in the absence ofassociated health problems and co-drug abuse (eg, alcohol). Our studies alsobegin to establish the importance of dose (concentration) and critical perinatalperiods of exposure to specific outcomes. The present results with our clinicallyrelevant animal model of repeated, brief, high-concentration binge prenataltoluene exposure demonstrate the dose-dependent effect of toluene on prenataldevelopment, early postnatal maturation, spontaneous exploration, andamphetamine-induced locomotor activity. The results imply that abuse patterns oftoluene exposure may be more deleterious than typical occupational exposure onfetal development and suggest that animal models are effective in studying themechanisms and risk factors of organic solvent teratogenicity.",16808045,16808045

Humid sucralfate gel and microwave-dried gel exhibitedantacid effectiveness. In particular, the neutralization rate of dried gelpowders was inversely related to the water content: as the water content of driedpowders decreased, the acid reaction rate linearly increased. The relationshipwas due to the different morphology of dried sucralfate gels. In fact, theporosity of the dried samples increased with the water reduction. However, theacid neutralization equivalent revealed that the dried sucralfate gel became moreresistant to acid attack in the case of water content below 42%.

The gloss variationresults were compared with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and averagesurface roughness values that were measured by conventional diamond stylusprofilometry. The profilometry data showed a decrease in tablet surface roughnessas a function of compression force. In general, a smoother surface contributes tohigher average gloss values. The average gloss values for this material, incontrast, showed a decrease as a function of the compression force. The sequenceof particle fragmentation and deformation together with crack formation in sodiumchloride particles resulted in a loss of gloss for single sodium chlorideparticles at the tablet surfaces, which could be detected by the DOG.

Theformulations were injected using the dynamic injection apparatus into a flowingstream of isotonic Sorensen's phosphate buffer at rates of 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2mL/min. The peaks obtained with the spectrophotometer were reproducible for eachinjection rate/formulation combination. For the phosphate-buffered formulation,the least amount of precipitation was obtained at the 0.25 mL/min injection rate.Acetate buffer was able to substantially reduce such precipitation, even at thehighest injection rate. The opacity peaks for the formulation with the acetateaddition were significantly smaller (P < .05) than those obtained for theunaltered formulation at all 4 injection rates.

In this study the applicability, performance, anddiagnostic yield of sonoenteroclysis were assessed and the results of this novelmethod were compared with those of barium enteroclysis. METHODS: Forty-fiveconsecutive patients with suspected small bowel disorder were studied. Allpatients underwent abdominal ultrasound before and after infusion of an isotonicnonabsorbable electrolyte solution containing polyethylene glycol through anasojejunal tube (modified Billbao Dotter tube), and images at various levelswere obtained. Small bowel wall thickness, luminal narrowing, intestinaldilatation, peristalsis, and extraintestinal complications were noted. It wasfollowed by barium enteroclysis and findings were recorded. Findings ofsonoenteroclysis were compared with those of barium enteroclysis. RESULTS:Satisfactory distention of the intestinal lumen was obtained with sequentialvisualization of jejunoileal loops in 34.4 +/- 18.4 min. Of 45 patients, 10showed normal small bowel on sonoenteroclysis and barium enteroclysis. These 10patients served as controls. Sonoenteroclysis displayed normal diameters smallerthan 3.0 and 2.0 cm for the jejunum and ileum, respectively. Bowel wall thicknesswas 1.7 to 3.0 mm and all five layers of bowel wall could be well appreciated.Valvulae conniventes were clearly visualized with a fold thickness between 1.4and 2.0 mm. The remaining 35 patients showed abnormalities in the form ofstrictures, matted bowel loops, dilated loops, thickened folds, deformedileocecal junction, mass lesions, etc., on sonoenteroclysis and bariumenteroclysis. In addition, sonoenteroclysis showed thickened bowel wall with lossof stratification. Extraintestinal findings such as enlarged lymph nodes andascites were also disclosed at the time of sonography.

Five of 12 cases of seeding were observed as a complication of 1080PAT procedures (0.46%) performed in 545 patients (0.96%) by two of the authors(L.T., G.F.) over a long period (15 years) at different institutions. The otherseven patients had been treated with PAT procedures at other institutions and hadcome to our attention during post-treatment follow-up. RESULTS: The 12 patientswho had seeding nodules had undergone the following PAT procedures: multisessionconventional percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) without anesthesia (fourpatients), single-session PEI with general anesthesia (three patients),single-session PEI with general anesthesia plus multisession conventional PEI(four patients), and single-session PEI plus radiofrequency ablation (onepatient).

We evaluated the radiologicfindings of autoimmune pancreatitis. METHODS: Computed tomographic, magneticresonance imaging, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographic, andultrasonographic findings of 20 patients with autoimmune pancreatitis in ourhospital between November 2000 and December 2003 were retrospectively reviewedregarding changes and ancillary findings in the pancreatic parenchyma, the mainpancreatic duct, peripancreatic vessels, and distal common bile duct. Inaddition, follow-up images were reviewed for changes in any abnormality seen onthe initial examinations. RESULTS: Pancreatic parenchymal enlargement wasinvariably seen that was diffuse (n = 19) or focal (n = 1), with homogeneouscontrast enhancement on computed tomography (n = 20) and magnetic resonanceimaging (n = 15). Capsule-like rim enhancement was seen in six patients. Therewas focal (n = 18) or diffuse (n = 2) narrowing of the main pancreatic duct andit was usually multifocal (n = 17) in the former. Narrowing of the peripancreaticveins was seen in 14 patients.

On T2-weighted fastspin-echo images, standard deviation ratio of HCCs correlated directly withVEGF(IND) values of HCCs. By CT hepatic arteriography, the contrast-enhancementindex of HCCs showed a moderate inverse correlation with VEGF(IND) values ofHCCs, and the contrast-enhancement index of the liver showed marginal, moderatedirect correlation with VEGF(IND) values in the liver.

Subjects were randomized to water (n = 30),fiber solution (n = 32), polyethylene glycol (PEG; n = 11), or dilute iodinatedsolution (DI; n = 25). Examinations were then evaluated for gastric distention,small bowel distention, small bowel wall visualization, and colonic transit. Aquestionnaire was given to the study subjects for feedback concerning taste andpotential side effects from these agents. RESULTS: PEG tended to provide betterbowel distention, wall visualization, and colonic transit compared with water,fiber solution, and DI. Areas of statistical significance included: (1) averagebowel diameter in the left upper quadrant for water was 17.50 mm, whereas thatfor PEG was 21.88 mm (p < 0.05); (2) average bowel diameter in the pelvis forwater was 14.79 mm, that for fiber was 15.67 mm, and that for PEG was 18.48 mm (p< 0.05); (3) wall visualization was better with PEG than with fiber (p < 0.05);(4) successful transit of contrast to the colon occurred in every subject whoreceived PEG compared with only 20% of those received water and 39% of those whoreceived fiber (p < 0.05).

Lack ofadequate time to do the job required, career needs interfering with family needs,and lack of adequate faculty help with residency matters were identified as themost important problems (means of 3.5 [95% CI = 3.2 to 3.7], 3.4 [95% CI = 3.2 to3.6], and 3.1 [95% CI = 2.9 to 3.3], respectively, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5as maximum). This study identified multiple resources that were found to beuseful by >50% of PDs, including national meetings, lectures, advice from others,and self-study. CONCLUSIONS: Emergency medicine PDs generally are very satisfiedwith the position of PD, perhaps because of increased support and resources.Although PD turnover remains an issue, PDs intend to remain in the position for alonger period of time than noted before this study. This may reflect the overallsatisfaction with the position as well as the increased resources and support nowavailable to the PD. PDs have greater satisfaction if they have been mentored forthe position.",16436795,16436795

The authors sought to examine the effectof glycemic control on mortality after acute stroke. METHODS: This was aretrospective study of patients discharged with a diagnosis of ischemic strokeduring a 40-month period from a large urban U.S. health system. Patients werecompared by initial blood glucose (BG) levels and by glycemic control during thefirst 48 hours of hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 960 patients with thromboembolicstroke, 373 (38.9%) were hyperglycemic (BG > or = 130 mg/dL) on hospitaladmission. Admission hyperglycemia was associated with a higher mortality ratethan was euglycemia (odds ratio [OR] = 3.15; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.45to 6.85; p = 0.004). Persistent hyperglycemia (PerHyp) during 48 hours ofhospitalization was associated with even higher mortality rate (unadjustedlogistic regression, OR = 6.54; 95% CI = 2.41 to 17.87; p < 0.001). Glycemiccontrol (normalization of BG to < 130 mg/dL) was associated with a 4.6-folddecrease in mortality risk as compared with the case of patients with PerHyp (p <0.001). Multiple logistic regression showed glycemic control to be a strongindependent determinant of survival (OR = 5.95; 95% CI = 1.24 to 28.6; p = 0.026)after acute stroke even after adjustment for age, gender, concomitanthypertension and diabetes, and stroke severity. CONCLUSIONS: Admissionhyperglycemia is associated with a worse outcome after stroke than is euglycemia.Normalization of blood glucose during the first 48 hours of hospitalizationappears to confer a potent survival benefit in patients with thromboembolicstroke.",16436794,16436794

In this study, the authors determine whether pain treatment andrelief in ED patients are negatively associated with the physician's perceptionof whether the patient was exaggerating symptoms, and with the patient andphysician's perceptions of the interaction between them, as well as whetherdemographic characteristics were associated with these perceptions. METHODS: Thiswas a prospective observational study of patients who were undergoing treatmentfor painful disorders in the ED. Before treatment for pain, patients were askedto complete a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) describing their pain. Demographicinformation and pain treatments administered were recorded. Patients completed asecond pain VAS before discharge from the ED. Patients were then asked tocomplete three queries describing their perception of their interaction with thephysician. After the patient had left the department, the patient's physician wasasked to complete a query describing his or her perception of the interaction andto complete a VAS describing how likely it was that the patient was exaggeratingsymptoms to obtain pain medicines for nonmedical purposes. RESULTS: There were1,695 patients enrolled in the study; 32 patients were excluded because ofmissing or incomplete data, leaving 1,663 for analysis. Of these patients, 71.9%received a pain medication while in the ED. There was no association between thephysician's VAS for perceived exaggeration of symptoms, the queries describingphysician-patient interactions, and patient ethnicity and whether patientsreceived pain treatment in the ED. There was a negative correlation between thephysician's VAS for perceived exaggeration of symptoms and the change in thepatient's pre- and posttreatment pain VAS scores. The physician's VAS score forperceived exaggeration of symptoms was higher among Native American patients thanamong other ethnic groups (p < or = 0.001). The patient and physician queriesrating their interaction show a decreased absolute reduction of VAS pain scores(p > or = 0.001) and a reduction in the number of patients having at least a 50%reduction in their pain VAS score when interactions were rated ""bad"" and ""verybad"" (p < or = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The physician's perception of whether apatient was exaggerating symptoms was associated with the patient's ethnicbackground and with both the physician's and patient's perception of theirinteraction.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study withconvenience sampling. A survey was administered to adult emergency departmentpatients presenting with chest pain after emergency physicians obtained thehistory and performed the physical examination. No identifying data werecollected from the patients. In addition to demographics, patients were askedwhether or not their physician asked them about factors related to coronarysyndrome and myocardial infarction etiology. RESULTS: A total of 308 of 332patients (93%) participated. Patients had a mean age of 52 years, 54% were male,and 85% spoke English; classification by race was 31% African American, 28%white, 19% Hispanic, and 13% other. History taking did not differ by gender.Patients who reported being asked about the following were statisticallysignificantly younger than those who reported not being asked: family history,other medical problems, smoking, cocaine use, and alcohol use. Nonwhite patientsreported being asked about the following more frequently than white patients:smoking (94% vs. 84%), alcohol use (81% vs. 70%), and cocaine use (64% vs. 42%).In multivariate logistic regression controlling for age, nonwhite patients weremore likely than white patients to be asked about smoking (odds ratio [OR], 2.79;95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.26 to 6.19), cocaine use (OR, 2.49; 95% CI =1.50 to 4.12), and alcohol use (OR, 1.77; 95% CI = 1.0 to 3.09).

METHODS: FromJuly to September 2004, a randomized controlled trial of consecutive adultpatients with ankle or foot twisting injuries who arrived at an urgent caredepartment was conducted. Patients were included if their age was 18 years orolder and their injury had occurred within seven days. They were excluded ifthere were neurovascular deficits, limb deformities, open fractures, ornonisolated ankle or foot injuries. Patients were randomly allocated to aroentgenogram-ordering clinical pathway (intervention) or to standarddepartmental care (control). Those assigned to the intervention group had triagenurses applying the OAR, and those with positive OAR were sent for roentgenogramsbefore physician evaluation. Physicians were blinded to negative OAR nurseassessments. Investigators were blinded to group allocation. The primary outcomewas the total mean length of stay (TLOS). The secondary outcomes were patientsatisfaction (five-point ordinal scale) and the proportion willing to return tothe site for future care. Two-independent sample t-test was used to analyze theTLOS. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze satisfaction ratingsdifferences between groups. Fisher's exact test was used to analyze thewilling-to-return outcome. This study had 80% power to detect an effect size of25 minutes. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-two patients were eligible; 130 patientsgave consent and were enrolled. Three patients were then excluded, three werelost to follow-up, and one left without being seen. The intervention and controlgroups had mean TLOS of 73.0 minutes and 79.7 minutes, respectively.

It is often the emergency department(ED) physician who, while treating the initial event, has the first opportunityto initiate effective preventive strategies, including pharmacotherapy andbehavior modification. Evidence- and consensus-based guidelines are wellestablished for the use of antiplatelet medications, anticoagulants, andantihypertensives for prevention of secondary stroke. Recent evidence suggeststhat the use of statins may be associated with improved clinical outcomes afterischemic stroke. In addition, behavioral interventions, such as smokingcessation, exercise, diet, and stroke education, can help patients avoid strokerecurrence.

The coral snake is the only elapid that isnative to North America, but envenomations from non-native elapids are occurringmore commonly in this country. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacyof CSAV in the neutralization of two exotic elapid envenomations: Naja naja(Indian cobra) and Dendroaspis polylepsis (black mamba). METHODS: A randomized,blinded, placebo-controlled murine model of intraperitoneal venom injection wasemployed. Venom potency was determined in preliminary dosing studies. Studyanimals then were divided into five groups: 1) N. naja venom + CSAV, 2) N. najavenom + 0.9% normal saline (NS), 3) D. polylepsis venom + CSAV, 4) D. polylepsisvenom + NS, and 5) CSAV + NS. The venom dose was chosen to be twice the estimatedLD50. The amount of CSAV injected was ten times the amount necessary forneutralization of a 2 x LD50 dose of M. f. fulvius venom in a murine model.Statistical analysis included Fisher's exact and log-rank testing to comparesurvival rates and times. RESULTS: Preliminary studies estimated the venom LD50to be 2.58 mg/kg and 0.45 mg/kg, respectively, for the N. naja and D. polylepsis.A significant difference was shown in comparison of survival times betweenCSAV-venom groups and normal saline-venom groups despite all animals in bothtreatment and control arms dying. Animals receiving CSAV and N. naja venomsurvived (mean +/- SD) 24.4 +/- 3.0 minutes, versus 17.8 +/- 1.3 minutes in thecontrol group (p < 0.001), whereas those receiving CSAV and D. polylepsis venomsurvived 203.8 +/- 37.0 minutes versus 130.0 +/- 42.6 minutes in the controlgroup (p < 0.001).

Original research was identified; case reports, case series,abstracts, and meta-analysis were excluded. Articles were classified by authorreport of extramural funding as government (public), private nonprofit(foundation), for profit (industry), or multiple. Data are reported as percentper year per journal. A secondary analysis of MEDLINE was performed to identifypublishing trends by EM investigators outside of these four journals over thesame period. RESULTS: The primary analysis identified 5,728 articles; 3,278 (57%)were considered original research, with 32% of these reporting extramuralfunding.

There were 103 consecutive nonrandomized adulttrauma patients who required immediate tube thoracostomy during their initialresuscitation who were entered into the study. The Mac-technique test wasperformed during standard tube thoracostomy insertion to the appropriate depth.The test involved grasping the external portion of the thoracostomy tube, turningit clockwise 180 degrees, and then releasing the tube. If the tube spontaneouslyspun back to its original position, the test was considered positive, and thetube was considered kinked. If the tube did not spontaneously spin back andstayed in position upon release, the test was considered negative. Regardless ofthe results of this test, the tube was secured, and a postprocedure chestradiograph was obtained. The criterion standard for determining a kinked chesttube was its appearance on this chest radiograph. RESULTS: A total of 103 chesttubes were placed by using the Mac-technique test. The test was positive in eightplacements; four tubes were kinked on chest radiograph. The Mac-technique testwas negative in 95 placements; four tubes were kinked on chest radiograph.

The sensitivity of these codes was 45.9% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] =41.3% to 50.2%) with a specificity of 97.8% (95% CI = 97.6% to 97.9%).CONCLUSIONS: The identification of mild TBI patients using retrospectivelyassigned ICD-9 codes appears to be inaccurate. These codes are associated with asignificant number of false-positive and false-negative code assignments. MildTBI incidence and prevalence estimates using these codes should be interpretedwith caution. ICD-9 codes should not replace a clinical assessment for mild TBIwhen accurate case ascertainment is required.",16365331,16365331

METHODS: Nineteen healthy subjects were used totest five AEDs available on the Austrian market in a prospective, open, andsequence-randomized study. The primary outcome variable was the absolute numberof shocks advised in the presence of EMI. The secondary outcome was the number ofimpaired analyses caused by incorrectly detected patient movements or electrodefailure. RESULTS: Of 760 tests run, 18 (2.37%) cases of false-positive resultsoccurred, and two of five AEDs recommended shocks in the presence of sinusrhythm. Of 760 tests run, no electrode failures occurred. There were 27occurrences (3.55%) of motion detected by an AED in the presence of strongelectromagnetic fields.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of a queueing model inidentifying provider staffing patterns to reduce the fraction of patients wholeave without being seen. METHODS: The authors collected detailed ED arrival datafrom an urban hospital and used a Lag SIPP queueing analysis to gain insights onhow to change provider staffing to decrease the proportion of patients who leavewithout being seen. The authors then compared this proportion for the same39-week period before and after the resulting changes. RESULTS: Despite anincrease in arrival volume of 1,078 patients (6.3%), an average increase inprovider hours of 12 hours per week (3.1%) resulted in 258 fewer patients wholeft without being seen. This represents a decrease in the proportion of patientswho left without being seen by 22.9%. Restricting attention to a four-day subsetof the week during which there was no increase in total provider hours, areallocation of providers based on the queueing model resulted in 161 fewerpatients who left without being seen (21.7%), despite an additional 548 patients(5.5%) arriving in the second half of the study.

During the last two years at the authors'institution, this agent has been used as an off-label treatment for urinary tractinfections in children. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate antimicrobial susceptibilitytesting data in children to determine whether there is support for thisprescribing practice. METHODS: In this retrospective study (2003-2004), theauthors compared the susceptibility patterns of urinary pathogens to cefdinir andselected antibiotics in children who were evaluated for urinary tract infectionsin an urban tertiary academic pediatric emergency department. Pathogens(community acquired vs. opportunistic or nosocomial) were categorized assusceptible, indeterminate, or resistant on the basis of antibioticsusceptibility breakpoints. The frequency of these categorizations for individualdrugs was determined. RESULTS: Seven hundred five isolates were recovered fromurine during the study period. Pathogens isolated most frequently wereEscherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, and Proteus spp. Of 431 isolates retained inthe data set, 412 (95.6%) were susceptible to cefdinir. This rate was comparableor superior to rates observed for other antibiotics: 49.4% for ampicillin, 84.9%for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 88.4% for cefazolin, 93.3% for nitrofurantoin,94.2% for ticarcillin-clavulanate potassium, 97.5% for gentamicin, and 97.7% forceftriaxone. Cefdinir, however, had lower activity (64.7%) against 17 bacterialisolates categorized as opportunistic or nosocomial pathogens. CONCLUSIONS:Cefdinir provides good coverage against common pathogens responsible for urinarytract infections in children and compares favorably with other oral andparenteral antibiotics that are used in the empiric treatment of this infection.",16365328,16365328

Theauthors hypothesized that several variables would be associated with stage ofchange, including nicotine dependence, self-efficacy, presence of asmoking-related illness, and anticipated cessation-related health improvement.METHODS: For two 24-hour periods, consecutive patients and visitors aged 18 yearsand older presenting to four Boston EDs were interviewed. The authors assessed arange of smoking-related constructs. Exclusion criteria included severe illness,cognitive insufficiency, and acute distress. RESULTS: One thousand ten subjectswere screened (56% patients, 44% visitors). Two hundred thirty-seven (23%)subjects were current smokers, with 57% being in precontemplation, 31% incontemplation, and 12% in preparation stages.

METHODS: This was aretrospective cohort analysis. Three thousand nine hundred nineteen true matchesbetween ambulance and state trauma registry data from 1998 to 2003 wereidentified by deterministic matching on trauma identification number and verifiedby human review. Two thousand thirty-eight ambulance records from trauma patientsnot meeting criteria for a true match, and an identical number of trauma registryrecords randomly selected from the one local county served by a different EMSprovider, were included as nonmatches. There were 17 variables considered forlinkage, which included the following: age, gender, race, county, hospital, date,rural setting, call and arrival times, mechanism, penetrating injury, vitalsigns, intubation, and intoxication. Probabilistic linkage was used to link thetwo data sets, using seven different combinations of common variables (maximum,17; minimum, 4). The sensitivity and specificity of identifying true matches andnonmatches (95% confidence intervals [95% CI]) were calculated for eachcombination of variables. RESULTS: Using all 17 available variables, 3,766 of3,919 true matches were appropriately linked (sensitivity, 96.1%; 95% CI = 95.4%to 96.7%), with eight mismatches (specificity, 99.6%; 95% CI = 99.2% to 99.8%).Sensitivity fell below 95% with < 15 variables; however, sensitivity was verydependent on the inclusion of variables with high discriminatory power.Specificity remained >98% regardless of the number of variables included.CONCLUSIONS: Probabilistic linkage is a valid method for matching ambulancerecords to a trauma registry without the use of patient identifiers; however, thesensitivity of identifying true matches is critically dependent on the number andtype of common variables included in the analysis.",16365326,16365326

The authors hypothesized that lazaroid U-83836E maybe beneficial in a shock model with hemorrhage combined with limb ischemia.Furthermore, the authors hypothesized that lazaroids induce expression of heatshock proteins (HSPs) of the 72-kDa family. METHODS: Rats were divided into twogroups (lazaroid and control groups, n = 8 each) and pretreated with the lazaroidU-83836E (5 mg/kg) or with vehicle intraperitoneally at 12 and 24 hours beforeexperiments. At the time of the experiment, rats were anesthetized, and thefemoral artery of each rat was cannulated. After 20 minutes of stabilization,blood was shed from each rat to bring its mean arterial pressure to 24-28 mmHgfor 2 hours. Bilateral tourniquets were tightened proximally on the rat thighsduring those 2 hours and then released. Shed blood plus equal amounts of Ringeracetate then were infused to restore normal blood pressure, followed by acontinuous infusion of Ringer acetate, the rate of which was regulated tomaintain blood pressure, until 30 minutes after start of resuscitation. Fluidresuscitation was stopped, and rats were observed for another 3.5 hours. At theend of the observation period, the rats' hearts were collected for immunoblotanalysis of HSP72.

The purpose of this randomized,double-blind, sham control study was to determine whether auricular acupressurecan decrease not only the level of anxiety but also the level of pain in a groupof elder patients with acute hip fracture. METHODS: With the assistance of theVienna Red Cross, 38 patients with acute hip fracture were enrolled into thisstudy. Patients were randomized into two study groups: the true interventiongroup and the sham control group. Subjects in the true intervention group (n =18) received bilateral auricular acupressure at three auricular acupressurepoints for hip pain. Patients in the sham group (n = 20) received bilateralauricular acupressure at sham points. Baseline demographic information, anxietylevel, pain level, blood pressure, and heart rate were obtained before theadministration of the appropriate acupressure intervention.

On a questionnaire that usedvarious rating scales, residents reported the value of educational activities,frequency of administrative tasks interfering with education, and educationalsatisfaction after duty hours were reduced. The authors compared univariatestatistics and developed multivariable models to discern the relationship betweenhours worked and educational outcomes. RESULTS: In all, 125 residents (76%)responded. Residents rated the educational activities, morning report, andteaching others most highly. Answering pages and tasks related to scheduling werethe most frequent barriers to educational activities. Residents reported thattime spent in administrative activities did not change after duty-hourrestrictions, and 68% said that decreased duty hours had no impact or a negativeimpact on education.

RESULTS: There were significant andnotable differences in the experiences of the two cohorts. Students' perceptionsof the quality of their experiences in the surgery-oriented clerkships(obstetrics-gynecology and surgery) in particular were significantly lower (i.e.,more negative) in the 2003-04 cohort than in the previous cohort for the sameclerkships.

The authors examined whether work-relatedstressors in academic medicine negatively affected the physical and mentalhealth, as well as life and job satisfaction, of academic medical school faculty.METHOD: A 136-item self-administered anonymous questionnaire modified from asmall 1984 study was distributed to 3,519 academic faculty at four U.S. medicalschools following institutional review board approval at each school. Validatedscales measuring depression, anxiety, work strain, and job and life satisfaction;a checklist of common physical and mental health symptoms; and questions aboutthe impact of institutional financial stability, colleague attrition, and otherwork-related perceptions were used. Responses were analyzed by sex, academicrank, age, marital status, faculty discipline, and medical school. RESULTS:Responses were received from 1,951 full-time academic physicians and basicscience faculty, a 54.3% response rate. Twenty percent of faculty, almost equalby sex, had significant levels of depressive symptoms, with higher levels inyounger faculty. Perception of financial instability was associated with greaterlevels of work strain, depression, and anxiety. Significant numbers of facultyacknowledged that work-related strain negatively affected their mental health andjob satisfaction, but not life satisfaction or physical health. Specialties weredifferentially affected. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of depression, anxiety, and jobdissatisfaction-especially in younger faculty-raise concerns about the well-beingof academic faculty and its impact on trainees and patient care.

METHOD: In 2003-04,semistructured interviews of 18 deans at U.S. colleges of medicine or AMCs wereorganized around four dimensions: background, leadership challenges,organizational effectiveness, and systems enablers/restrainers for leadership. Avalues Q-sort was used to determine how widely core values were shared amongdeans and how the complex challenges they faced did or did not align with thesevalues. RESULTS: Fourteen of the 18 (78%) deans identified financial difficultiesas their most pressing leadership challenge, followed by weak institutionalalignment (61%), staffing problems (33%), and poor morale (28%). Open, candidcommunication was reported as the most effective means of addressing thesecomplex problems. Enacting espoused shared values and having a positive attitudewere identified as the most important enablers of systemic leadership, whereasmicromanagement and difficult people were the major restraints. Q-sort results on38 positive leadership values indicated that participants considered integritymost essential. Integrity was positively correlated with humanistic values andnegatively correlated with results. Vision, another highly espoused value,correlated strongly with performance-oriented values but correlated negativelywith humanistic values.

Little is knownabout the effect of new accreditation requirements on GME practice and outcomes.The authors conducted a cross-sectional survey designed to provide descriptivedata about DIOs and to validate a DIO Responsibility Scale (DIORS). METHOD: DIOswere identified by the ACGME. The following delivery strategy was used toadminister the survey from January 2004 to May 2004: prenotice letter; surveywith self-addressed, stamped return envelope and cover letter; thank-you/reminderpostcard; and replacement survey with new cover letter and self-addressed,stamped return envelope. RESULTS: Completed surveys were received from 243 of 363DIOs (66.9%). Responses indicated wide ranges in DIO titles, report titles, timespent accomplishing responsibilities, DIO-specific salaries, credentials, andGraduate Medical Education Committee reporting arrangements. DIOs reportedconfusion or overlap between DIO and program director roles (72.0%), decreasingfunding for GME (50.6%), and inadequate support staff (25.1%). The 11-item DIOResponsibility Scale demonstrated a Cronbach alpha of .86 and a statisticallysignificant relationship to five variables selected to establish constructvalidity. CONCLUSIONS: The wide variability in DIO characteristics found in thisstudy supports the premise that the DIO role is underdeveloped.

The aim of this approach is toenable predictions of the effect of perturbations in geometry or functionalparameters on imaged function of the lung. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computationaltechniques that can deal with anatomic detail and spatially distributed nonlinearmaterial properties are used to model parenchymal soft-tissue mechanics in aphysically realistic model of the ovine lung. The lung is modeled as ahomogeneous, compressible, nonlinearly elastic body. Using equations for largedeformation mechanics, change in geometry of the lung is simulated at staticinflation pressures from 25 cm H2O to 0 cm H2O. Multidetector row computedtomography imaging defines the model geometry, the movement of the model lungsurface during inflation, and displacement of airway bifurcations for comparisonwith predicted internal displacements of the model. RESULTS: A novel modelingframework has been formulated that links equations for large deformation of thelung tissue to equations for airway flow and pressure. This preliminary modelpredicts airway displacements that are in good agreement with imageddisplacements (total root mean square [RMS] error < 4 mm from 25 to 0 cm H2O).CONCLUSIONS: State-of-the-art computed tomography imaging is interpreted using amodeling framework to predict ventilation distribution and changes in thegeometry of the lung during increments in inflation pressure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tenradiologists independently interpreted 104 mammograms containing clusteredmicrocalcifications. Forty-six of these were malignant and 58 were benign atbiopsy. Radiologists read the images with and without a computer aid by using acounterbalanced study design. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated fromobserver biopsy recommendations, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC)curves were computed from their diagnostic confidence ratings. Unaideddouble-reading sensitivity and specificity values were derived post hoc by usingthree different objective rules and an additional rule of simulated-optimaldouble reading that assumed that consultations for resolving two radiologists'different independent diagnoses always produce the correct clinicalrecommendation. ROC curves of unaided double readings were obtained according tothe literature. RESULTS: Single reading without computer aid yielded 74%sensitivity and 32% specificity, whereas CAD reading yielded 87% sensitivity and42% specificity and appeared on a higher ROC curve (P < .0001).

"1","16399035","Academic radiology","Kurmis TP","RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Stratifying candidates objectively on the merit ofpublication portfolios is an onerous and difficult task. Institutional committeesare under increasing pressure to rank applicants based on previous achievementsfor appointments/promotions, funding, and awards, and must do so withinunforgiving time constraints. The journal impact factor (IF) has been looselyadopted in many circles for assessing article ""quality,"" circumventing detailedreview of individual articles. The premise supporting such practice often hingeson assuming that high-IF journals are harder to publish in, for example, havehigher rejection rates (RRs), and therefore, authors achieving publication insuch periodicals should be ""recognized"" for their achievement. There is noevidence of previous research linking IF and RR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A subsetof Institute for Scientific Information (ISI)-listed radiology journals, forwhich IF data were available, was identified and a direct-contact survey approach(63.3% response rate) used to ascertain journal manuscript RR. RESULTS: Of thesample reviewed, the ISI-listed IF values ranged from 4.759 to 0.056 (mean1.491), and editor-reported manuscript RRs from 80.0% to 8.0% (mean 47.8%).Statistical comparison of IF and RR using linear regression yielded an r2 valueof 0.223. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this study demonstrates poor linear agreementbetween IF and RR for manuscripts submitted to peer-reviewed radiology journals.This suggests that journal IF is a poor predictor of RR, and vice versa.

Specifically, tumor segmentation is a key componentin the computerized assessment of likelihood of malignancy. However, manualdelineation of lesions in four-dimensional MR images is labor intensive andsubject to interobserver and intraobserver variations. We developed acomputerized lesion segmentation method that has the advantage of beingautomatic, efficient, and objective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present a fuzzyc-means (FCM) clustering-based method for the segmentation of breast lesions inthree dimensions from contrast-enhanced MR images. The proposed lesionsegmentation algorithm consists of six consecutive stages: region of interest(ROI) selection by a human operator, lesion enhancement within the selected ROI,application of FCM on the enhanced ROI, binarization of the lesion membershipmap, connected-component labeling and object selection, and hole-filling on theselected object. We applied the algorithm to a clinical MR database consisting of121 primary mass lesions. Manual segmentation of the lesions by an expert MRradiologist served as a reference in the evaluation of the computerizedsegmentation method. We also compared the proposed algorithm with a previouslydeveloped volume-growing (VG) method. RESULTS: For the 121 mass lesions in ourdatabase, 97% of lesions were segmented correctly by means of the proposedFCM-based method at an overlap threshold of 0.4, whereas 84% of lesions werecorrectly segmented by means of the VG method.

"1","16399032","Academic radiology","Wang G","RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Temporal studies (such as blood perfusion) commonly areused to measure function. Radiation dosage is a primary limiting factor for thesescans. Half-scan reconstruction can decrease dosage and improve temporalresolution, but is not viable for quantitative studies because of shadingartifact. We propose a method for identifying the artifact and minimizing itseffect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: It is possible to measure the shading artifact byproducing both a full-scan and a half-scan reconstruction from the sameprojection data. A correlation was shown between the subset of data used forreconstruction and per-pixel variation. Furthermore, this variation can beparameterized by only the center angle of the projection data. By performing asingle full-scan acquisition, it is possible to generate many half-scanreconstructions and measure the artifact; then future half-scan acquisitions canbe corrected. RESULTS: The artifact is caused by the inhomogeneity in the objectbeing scanned. Before correction, the root mean square error between thehalf-scan reconstruction and the full-scan is 41.0. After correction, the erroris decreased to 10.7, or 26% of the original value. CONCLUSION: We present amethod that can measure and correct for object-dependent half-scan shadingartifact.

Moreover, majorstereotactic brain atlases are based on the AC and PC. Our goal is to provide analgorithm for a rapid, robust, accurate and automatic identification of AC andPC. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The method exploits anatomical and radiologicalproperties of AC, PC and surrounding structures, including morphologicalvariability. The localization is done in two stages: coarse and fine. The coarsestage locates the AC and PC on the midsagittal plane by analyzing theirrelationships with the corpus callosum, fornix, and brainstem. The fine stagerefines the AC and PC in a well-defined volume of interest, analyzing locationsof lateral and third ventricles, interhemispheric fissure, and massa intermedia.RESULTS: The algorithm was developed using simple operations, like histogramming,thresholding, region growing, 1D projections. It was tested on 94 diversified T1Wand SPGR datasets. After the fine stage, 71 (76%) volumes had an error between0-1 mm for the AC and 55 (59%) for the PC. The mean errors were 1.0 mm (AC) and1.0 mm (PC). The accuracy has improved twice due to fine stage processing. Thealgorithm took about 1 second for coarse and 4 seconds for fine processing on P4,2.5 GHz.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: These structures areextracted automatically on the midsagittal plane. The CC and Fo are modeled usingbest-fit ellipses. The parameters characterizing these structures andrelationships among them are points, distances, angles, and eccentricities. Theminimum, maximum and mean values, standard deviations, and coefficients ofvariation for all parameters are calculated for 62 diversified MRI datasets.Subsequently, the regression analysis and parameter distribution study areperformed. RESULTS: The parameters have at least 10% variations. The major axisof CC and eccentricities of CC and Fo vary much less than the other parametersThe major axis of CC is approximately parallel to the AC-PC line. The meaneccentricity of each of CC and Fo is greater than 0.95. The most significantcorrelation (P < .05) is observed between various angles and the angle betweenthe major axes of CC and Fo. The correlation is also significant between otherangles and distances. The Weibull distribution characterizes the major axis ofCC, and distance between the AC and the most superior point of CC. Distributionof angle between the major axes of CC and Fo is log (logistic), and normal forthe AC-PC distance.

An optical flow method (OFM) was adapted foruse on CT lung images to register images and visualize changes between studies.Three applications were investigated: lung nodule assessment; evaluation ofpulmonary enhancement; and functional changes due to air trapping. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: From an initial clinical study, a follow-up study was created bydigitally manipulating the images to simulate patient positioning errors andnodule growth. Nodule growth was measured from the temporal subtraction ofregistered images. In application to the assessment of pulmonary enhancement, preand postcontrast images from a patient with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) wereregistered. A map of the perfused blood volume was computed from the ratio ofaligned lung volumes. Functional changes in the lung were demonstrated usingimages from a patient with air trapping. End-inspiratory and end-expiratoryvolumes were aligned and displacement fields estimated using the OFM. Principalstrains were computed from the displacement fields. RESULTS: All image volumeswere aligned with at least 0.95 correlation. OFM estimates of displacement showedexcellent agreement with the prescribed displacements with 0.33 pixel RMS error.Nodule growth was evident in the presence of significant positioning errors. Inthe PE case, enhancement ratios indicated a hypoperfused area consistent with anocclusive hypodense filling defect.

METHODS: Wemerged previously developed costs per victim by abbreviated injury scale (AIS)score into U.S. crash data files that scored injuries in both the AIS andpolice-coded severity scales to estimate injury costs, then aggregated theestimates into costs per crash by maximum injury severity. RESULTS: The mostcostly crashes were non-intersection fatal/disabling injury crashes on a roadwith a speed limit of 50 miles per hour or higher where multiple vehicles crashedhead-on or a single vehicle struck a human (over 1.69 US dollars and 1.16 millionUS dollars per crash, respectively).

Head-on crashes on these roads account for less than5% of the crashes, but they are responsible for almost half of all fatalities.Data analyzed in this study was provided by Maine Department of Transportationand covers all head-on crashes for 2000-2002 during which period there were 3,136head-on crashes reported. Out of these, 127 were fatal crashes and 235 producedincapacitating but not fatal injuries. These two categories made up over 75% ofthe crash cost. A clear majority of head-on crashes on two-lane, rural roads inMaine were caused by drivers making errors or misjudging situations.Illegal/unsafe speed was a factor in 32% of the crashes while driverinattention/distraction was a primary factor in 28%. Fatigue was responsible foraround one in 40 crashes and one in 12 fatal crashes. Alcohol or drugs was afactor in one in 12 crashes and one in nine fatal head-on crashes. Less than 8%of fatalities involved someone overtaking another vehicle, and only around 14%involved a driver intentionally crossing the centerline. Two in three fatalhead-on crashes occurred on straight segments and 67% of these happened on drypavement. There is a clear trend towards higher speed limits leading to a higherpercentage of crashes becoming fatal or having incapacitating injuries. There isalso a clear trend - if one keeps speeds constant and AADT within a certain range- that wider shoulders give higher crash severities. Also, for higher-speedroads, more travel lanes (than two) increase crash severity. In summary, thereseems to be two major reasons why people get across the centerline and havehead-on collisions: (a) people are going too fast for the roadway conditions; or(b) people are inattentive and get across the centerline more or less withoutnoticing it. The latter category of crashes could probably be reduced ifcenterline rumble-strips were installed. More or less all head-on collisionscould be eliminated if median barriers were installed. In-vehicle technologycould also be used to significantly reduce the incidence of lane departures.Furthermore, today's speed limits should be better enforced since a highpercentage of serious crashes involve illegal speeding.

CrimeDelinq. 30 (2), 123-135] reconceptualisation of deterrence theory to a group ofrecidivist drink drivers to explain their self-reported offending behaviours. Theanalysis indicated that punishment avoidance exerted the greatest influence onself-reported offending behaviours, although perceptions of arrest certainty andseverity also appear associated with drink driving offences. In contrast,vicarious exposure to others who have been punished or avoided punishment was notassociated with further drink driving behaviours. The results suggest thatrecidivist drink drivers are not heavily influenced by vicarious experiences, andthat past behaviour is an efficient predictor of future behaviour. The findingshave direct implications for the reconceptualisation and application ofdeterrence models to elucidate offending behaviours.",16405859,16405859

The objective of this study is the development of a crash predictionmodel that can be used to estimate the likelihood of a driver being at fault fora near future crash occurrence. Multiple logistic regression techniques wereemployed using the available data for the Kentucky licensed drivers. This studyconsiders as crash predictors the driver's total number of previous crashes,citations accumulated, the time gap between the latest two crashes, crash type,and demographic factors. The driver's total number of previous crashes wasfurther disaggregated into the drivers' total number of previous at-fault andnot-at-fault crashes. The model can be used to correctly classify at-faultdrivers up to 74.56% with an overall efficiency of 63.34%. The total number ofprevious at-fault crash involvements, and having previous driver licensesuspensions and traffic school referrals are strongly associated with a driverbeing responsible for a subsequent crash. In addition, a driver's likelihood tobe at fault in a crash is higher for very young or very old, males, drivers withboth speeding and non-speeding citations, and drivers that had a recent crashinvolvement. Thus, the model presented here enables agencies to more activelymonitor the likelihood of a driver to be at fault in a crash.",16405858,16405858

The aim of the study is to analyse the effect on traffic accidents oftreatment of patients with alcohol-related problems. To do so, the prevalence oftraffic problems in a sample of patients with a diagnosed dependence on alcoholwas assessed for three periods: during their lifetime, in the year preceding thestart of treatment and over the year of treatment. A prospective study wascarried out of 176 patients (147 males, 29 females; mean age 42.9 years)diagnosed as alcohol dependent according to the DSM-IV criteria in threealcoholic treatment centres in Castilla y Leon, Spain. 36.9% of thealcohol-dependent patients had had some kind of traffic problem during their lifeand 8.5% in the year prior to starting treatment.

The effect ofvisual clutter was examined by requiring participants to drive in simple andcomplex road environments. Overall measures of driving performance werecollected, together with responses to roadway hazards and subjective measures ofdriver perceived workload. The two in-vehicle distraction tasks degraded overalldriving performance, degraded responses to hazards and increased subjectiveworkload. The performance decrements that occurred as a result of in-vehicledistraction were observed in both the simple and complex highway environments andfor drivers in different age groups. One key difference was that older driverstraveled at lower mean speeds in the complex highway environment compared withyounger drivers. The conclusions of the research are that both in-vehicle tasksimpaired several aspects of driving performance, with the entertainment systemdistracter having the greatest negative impact on performance, and that thesefindings were relatively stable across different driver age groups and differentenvironmental complexities.",16226211,16226211

First, there is a presumption in the road safety arena that the expectedincrease in the number of ageing drivers on the roads will lead to an increase incrashes. Second, despite extensive research on ageing drivers, especially ontheir increased vulnerability and reduced driving abilities, the most widelyrecommended road safety strategy relates to the control of their drivinglicenses. This presumption and the associated policy recommendation are basedmainly on the higher relative crash risks associated with ageing drivers comparedto their younger counterparts. This study, however, argues that the average crashrisks obtained in previous studies provide only indirect information concerningthese issues and any decision based on these results may produce unexpectedoutcomes. An analytical framework to examine the marginal effect of changing thedriver mix on the roads is proposed and a simple empirical model is estimated asan illustration.

The model identified femalesand older occupants (segmented by age 55-74, and 75 and older) as having asignificantly higher risk of severe injuries in a crash. Further, interactions ofolder females with other factors, such as occupant seat position, crash type, andenvironmental factors were also shown to significantly impact the relative riskof a severe injury. This study revealed that females 75 years and older had thelowest odds of injury among all female occupants studied (OR=1.16) while femalesbetween 55 and 74 years old have higher risk of severe injuries (OR=1.74). Allolder females (55 and older) were at greater risk for head-on, side-impact andrear-end collisions. Seatbelt use reduced severe injuries for females in this agegroup, but not to the same extent as the rest of the population studied.Additionally, crashes in severe weather, which were less likely to result insevere injuries for the general population, increased the risk of severe injuriesto females that were 55 and older. Among occupants of light trucks, sport utilityvehicles and vans, older females were less likely than others to be severelyinjured.

Are there important differences in perceptions between memberstates? Do these perceptions reflect the real significance of road accidentcauses? Data were collected from 23 countries, based on representative nationalsamples of at least 1000 respondents each (n=24,372). Face-to-face interviewswith fully licensed, active car drivers were conducted using a questionnairecontaining closed answer questions. Respondents were asked to rate 15 causes ofroad accidents, each using a six-point ordinal scale. The answers were analyzedby calculating Kendall's tau for each pair of items to form lower trianglesimilarity matrices per country and for Europe as a whole. These matrices werethen used as the input files for an individual difference scaling to draw aperceptual map of the 15 items involved. The hypothesized model on risk andprevalence fits the data well and enabled us to answer the three questions ofconcern. The subject space of the model showed that there are no relevantdifferences between the 23 countries.

Thecriterion outcome indicators were: (1) monthly motor vehicle casualties (majorinjuries and fatalities) for the city-regions of Windsor and Detroit and (2)Ontario and Michigan monthly motor vehicle fatalities occurring between 11:00p.m. and 3:00 a.m. for 4 years pre- and 3 years post-policy change. In order toexamine cross-border drinking consequences, data were disaggregated to assesstrends of motor vehicle injury collisions involving vehicles with US licenceplates and with US drivers aged 16-20 in the Windsor region; similarly trendswere assessed for motor vehicle injury collisions involving vehicles with Ontariolicence plates in the Detroit region. RESULTS: The Windsor region total motorvehicle casualty data showed a non-significant pre-post increase, while theDetroit region showed a statistically significant decrease for total motorvehicle casualties. In the Windsor region, a significant increase was found foralcohol-related motor vehicle casualties after the drinking hours were extended.However, the Detroit region showed a statistically significant decrease inalcohol-related motor vehicle casualties concomitant with Ontario's drinking hourextension.

Application ofthe Monte-Carlo method on observed and simulated French road crash data between1996 and 2000 allows comparing estimations produced by multilevel logistic models(MLM), Generalized Estimating Equation models (GEE) and logistic models (LM). Onthe strength of a bias study, MLM is the most efficient model while both GEE andLM underestimate parameters and confidence intervals. MLM is used as a marginalmodel and not as a random-effect model, i.e. only fixed effects are taken intoaccount. Random effects allow adjusting risks on the hierarchical structure,conferring an interpretative advantage to MLM over GEE. Nevertheless, great careis needed for data coding and quite a high number of crashes are necessary inorder to avoid problems and errors with estimates and estimate processes. Onbalance, MLM must be used when the number of vehicles per crash or the number ofoccupants per vehicle is high, when the LM results are questionable because theyare not in line with the literature or finally when the p-values associated torisk measures are close to 5%.
