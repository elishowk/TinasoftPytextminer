Results revealed that motorcyclistfatalities and injuries are strongly associated with normalized heating degreedays and precipitation inches, and that universal helmet laws are associated withlower motorcyclist fatality rates when these climate measures, and theirinteraction, are statistically controlled. This study shows that climate measureshave considerable promise as indirect measures (proxies) of motorcycling activityin generalized linear regression studies.",16202466,16202466

This paperdescribes and evaluates an innovative court-based intervention for repeatimpaired-driving offenders, the driving under the influence (DUI) IntensiveSupervision Program (DISP) developed in Multnomah County, Oregon. METHODS: Thehazard of re-offending was compared between DISP participants (N=460) and acomparison group (N=497). The stratified Cox proportional hazards model was usedto model the hazard of re-offense, adjusting for matching criteria and stratifiedby county of residence. RESULTS: Adjusted hazard of DUI re-offense for DISPparticipants was 0.52 that of comparison offenders (95% CI=0.36-0.76). DISPclients also had lower arrest rates for driving while revoked/suspended and forall other traffic offenses. CONCLUSION: Preliminary results suggest the DISP isan effective means of reducing recidivism among repeat impaired-drivingoffenders.",16202465,16202465
"1","16198299","Accident; analysis and prevention","Tay R","The purpose of this paper is to address two important issues regarding ageingdrivers. First, there is a presumption in the road safety arena that the expectedincrease in the number of ageing drivers on the roads will lead to an increase incrashes. Second, despite extensive research on ageing drivers, especially ontheir increased vulnerability and reduced driving abilities, the most widelyrecommended road safety strategy relates to the control of their drivinglicenses. This presumption and the associated policy recommendation are basedmainly on the higher relative crash risks associated with ageing drivers comparedto their younger counterparts. This study, however, argues that the average crashrisks obtained in previous studies provide only indirect information concerningthese issues and any decision based on these results may produce unexpectedoutcomes. An analytical framework to examine the marginal effect of changing thedriver mix on the roads is proposed and a simple empirical model is estimated asan illustration. In contrast to previous studies, we found that increasing thenumber of licenses issued to ageing drivers had only an insignificant impact onthe number of fatal crashes on the roads, suggesting that the concern over ageingdrivers may be a storm in a teacup.","16198299","16198299"
"1","16197912","Accident; analysis and prevention","Boyle LN","A logistic regression model was used in the prediction of injury severity forindividuals who are involved in a vehicular crash. The model identified femalesand older occupants (segmented by age 55-74, and 75 and older) as having asignificantly higher risk of severe injuries in a crash. Further, interactions ofolder females with other factors, such as occupant seat position, crash type, andenvironmental factors were also shown to significantly impact the relative riskof a severe injury. This study revealed that females 75 years and older had thelowest odds of injury among all female occupants studied (OR=1.16) while femalesbetween 55 and 74 years old have higher risk of severe injuries (OR=1.74). Allolder females (55 and older) were at greater risk for head-on, side-impact andrear-end collisions. Seatbelt use reduced severe injuries for females in this agegroup, but not to the same extent as the rest of the population studied.Additionally, crashes in severe weather, which were less likely to result insevere injuries for the general population, increased the risk of severe injuriesto females that were 55 and older. Among occupants of light trucks, sport utilityvehicles and vans, older females were less likely than others to be severelyinjured. In this case, older females appear better off in vehicles which arelarger and protect better in severe crashes. This research demonstrates thatcircumstances surrounding a crash greatly impact the severity of injuriessustained by older female occupants.",16197912,16197912
"1","16191426","Accident; analysis and prevention","Yannis G","A theoretical two-dimensional model on prevalence and risk was developed. Theobjective of this study was to validate this model empirically to answer threequestions: How do European drivers perceive the importance of several causes ofroad accidents? Are there important differences in perceptions between memberstates? Do these perceptions reflect the real significance of road accidentcauses? Data were collected from 23 countries, based on representative nationalsamples of at least 1000 respondents each (n=24,372). Face-to-face interviewswith fully licensed, active car drivers were conducted using a questionnairecontaining closed answer questions. Respondents were asked to rate 15 causes ofroad accidents, each using a six-point ordinal scale. The answers were analyzedby calculating Kendall's tau for each pair of items to form lower trianglesimilarity matrices per country and for Europe as a whole. These matrices werethen used as the input files for an individual difference scaling to draw aperceptual map of the 15 items involved. The hypothesized model on risk andprevalence fits the data well and enabled us to answer the three questions ofconcern. The subject space of the model showed that there are no relevantdifferences between the 23 countries. The group space of the model comprises fourquadrants, each containing several items (high perceived risk/low perceivedprevalence items; high perceived risk/high perceived prevalence items; lowperceived risk/high perceived prevalence items and low perceived risk/lowperceived prevalence items). Finally, perceptions of the items driving under theinfluence of alcohol, drugs and medicines and driving using a handheld orhands-free mobile phone are discussed with regard to their real significance incausing road accidents. To conclude, individual difference scaling offers somepromising possibilities to study drivers' perception of road accident causes.",16191426,16191426

METHODS:The study uses 1992-2002 data on motor vehicle fatalities among 15-17-year-olddrivers from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System to identify the effects of""good"", ""fair"", and ""marginal"" GDL programs based upon designations by theInsurance Institute for Highway Safety. Analysis is conducted using conditionalnegative binomial regressions with fixed effects. RESULTS: ""Good"" programs reducetotal fatalities among young drivers by 19.4% (c.i. -33.0%, -5.9%). ""Fair""programs reduce night-time young driver fatalities by 12.6% (c.i. -23.9%, -1.2%),but have no effect on day-time fatalities. ""Marginal"" programs had nostatistically meaningful effect on driver fatalities. All three types of programsreduced teen passenger fatalities, but the effects of limitations on the numberof passengers appear to have had only minimal effects in reducing fatalitiesamong young drivers themselves. CONCLUSIONS: Stronger GDL programs are moreeffective than weaker programs in reducing teenage motor vehicle fatalities.",16171767,16171767
"1","16169506","Accident; analysis and prevention","Compton C","PURPOSE: This study evaluated the cross-border safety impact of extended drinkinghours from 1:00 to 2:00 a.m., in licensed establishments in Ontario, Canada.METHODS: This study examined patterns in total and alcohol-related casualties in:(1) Windsor, Ontario, Canada compared to Detroit, Michigan, US with a 2:00 a.m.closing time, and (2) Ontario compared to Michigan for overall trends. Thecriterion outcome indicators were: (1) monthly motor vehicle casualties (majorinjuries and fatalities) for the city-regions of Windsor and Detroit and (2)Ontario and Michigan monthly motor vehicle fatalities occurring between 11:00p.m. and 3:00 a.m. for 4 years pre- and 3 years post-policy change. In order toexamine cross-border drinking consequences, data were disaggregated to assesstrends of motor vehicle injury collisions involving vehicles with US licenceplates and with US drivers aged 16-20 in the Windsor region; similarly trendswere assessed for motor vehicle injury collisions involving vehicles with Ontariolicence plates in the Detroit region. RESULTS: The Windsor region total motorvehicle casualty data showed a non-significant pre-post increase, while theDetroit region showed a statistically significant decrease for total motorvehicle casualties. In the Windsor region, a significant increase was found foralcohol-related motor vehicle casualties after the drinking hours were extended.However, the Detroit region showed a statistically significant decrease inalcohol-related motor vehicle casualties concomitant with Ontario's drinking hourextension. No similar trends were found for the province of Ontario and the stateof Michigan as a whole. Moreover, a significant decrease was found for injurycollisions involving vehicles with Ontario licence plates in the Detroit regionbut no similar pattern was found for injury collisions involving vehicles with USlicence plates and with 16-20-year-old US drivers in the Windsor region.DISCUSSION: These data seem to support a cross-border impact of the Ontarioextended drinking policy. A significant increase in alcohol-related motor vehiclecasualties was found in the Windsor region and concomitantly, significantdecreases in total and alcohol-related motor vehicle casualties were found in theDetroit region after the extended drinking hours amendment. The Ontariogovernment's belief that the extended drinking hour policy would ""reduce thenumber of patrons who cross the border when Ontario's bars and restaurants close""may have been realized.",16169506,16169506

STUDY DESIGN ANDSETTING: A hospital discharge register study on the hospitalisation for injurieswith a follow-up of 213509-person-years. RESULTS: During the 10-year studyperiod, altogether 20016 hospitalisations for injuries were registered. Over thisperiod, the annual incidence of hospitalisation for injuries declined with 26%,from 113.3 (95% CI: 108.7-118.0) per 1000 conscripts in 1990 to 84.1 (95% CI:80.0-88.2) in 1999. Summer and autumn were the seasons with the highest incidencerates. Half of the injuries were sprains, strains, or fractures, and in half ofthe injuries, the anatomical location involved was the lower limb. The leadingexternal causes of injuries were falls (31.8%) and injuries inflicted by foreignobjects or machinery (18.5%). CONCLUSION: Although hospitalisations for injuriesdeclined between 1990 and 1999, injuries are still an important cause ofmorbidity in the Finnish Defence Forces. Further studies to evaluate the riskfactors and mechanisms of injuries are needed to develop effective preventionstrategies.",16162331,16162331

Similarly, mobile phone use seems to be an increasing activity thusrepresenting a relevant traffic safety issue. This paper investigates the extentand variations in mobile phone use among drivers of heavy vehicles in Denmark.The data was collected through written questionnaires and had a response rate of58%. It was found that more than 99% of the drivers used mobile phones whiledriving. Despite a prohibition of hand-held mobile phone use while driving 31% ofthe drivers reported to do so. Analysis of the variations in usage found apositive significant relationship between driving hours and phone use. A negativelinear effect was found between age and phone use. Similarly, a positivesignificant association was found between the number of stops and the amount ofphone use. 0.5% reported that their use of mobile phones had contributed to anaccident, while 6% had experienced their mobile phone use causing a dangeroussituation. However, 66% reported experiencing dangerous situations because ofothers road users' mobile phone use. Various implications of the findings arediscussed particularly in relation to the drivers with high exposure.",16157285,16157285

An average of five fatalities occureach year in surface mines as a result of an equipment operator not being awareof a smaller vehicle, person or change in terrain near the equipment. Sensortechnology that can detect such obstacles and that also is designed for surfacemining applications is rare. Researchers worked closely with the radar systemmanufacturer to test and modify the system on large, off-highway dump trucks at asurface mine over a period of 2 years. The final system was thoroughly evaluatedby recording video images from a camera on the rear of the truck and by recordingall alarms from the rear-mounted radar. Data show that the system reliablydetected small vehicles, berms, people and other equipment. However, alarms fromobjects that posed no immediate danger were common, supporting the assertion thatsensor-based systems for proximity warning should be used in combination withother devices, such as cameras, that would allow the operator to check the sourceof any alarm.",16129405,16129405
